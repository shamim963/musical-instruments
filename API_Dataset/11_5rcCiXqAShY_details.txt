    "Transcript": "so you finally found some time to learn how to play guitar or at least i'm assuming so since you clicked on my video thanks for that by the way hi my name is ellen and i make free guitar tutorials right here on youtube and if you stick with me i promise you'll be playing your very first song by the end of this 10 minute video with only two of the most popular chords used in a lot of different popular songs so make sure to stay tuned to see what song that's gonna be well there's no time like the present so go ahead and dust the cobwebs off of your sixth string and let's get it tuned up so you're quickly going to learn that one of the most important things that has to happen before you can play your guitar is to make sure it's in tune there are so many free apps you can download to help tune your guitar and i'll link a bunch of them below but in this video today we're going to be using guitar tuna if your guitar is already in tune make sure to skip to this time here so that we can move on all right once you have your app open go ahead and place it next to your guitar strings all right so these babies over here by the head of your guitar those are called your tuners okay these are your tuning pegs and this is what we're going to use to tune your guitar so basically the way that this works is each of these tuning pegs is connected to a string so we're going to start with this very top string closest to you that's our e string and if you have your app open and you pluck that string it'll tell you whether you're too high or too low so you can see here i am too low so all we can do to fix that is you are going to either turn your peg left or right to make it higher and lower so go ahead and experiment see how mine's going higher so go ahead and keep twisting until that app tells you you're in tune [Music] so again i'm using guitar tuna but most other apps work this way as well so keep twisting left or right until each of those strings gives you a green light [Music] hey nice to see you're still with me i'm glad to see someone with more than a two-minute attention span kids these days am i right but i don't want to push my luck so let's go ahead and jump into the next section and learn how to play your very first chord alright so first let's go ahead and talk about the names of these strings starting with the side closest to you this is our low e string and it goes e a d g b e but no worries you don't have to memorize this now i will leave this on screen for you for the rest of this tutorial all right next let's go ahead and look at the neck of your guitar you'll see these metal bars throughout the neck those are called your frets and this is important because this is going to tell you where you want to put your fingers and you never want to put your fingers directly on these metal bars on these frets you want to put your fingers behind them all right so the way that we're going to talk about these frets is with numbers we've got first fret second fret third fret all right so let's go ahead and test this new skill if i told you to put your middle finger on the third fret of the low e string where do you think that would be that would be right here good job sorry to go a little door at the explorer on you but let's keep going so if i told you to put your pointer or index finger on the second fret of the a string where would that be you got it so we're already halfway there we got two of our fingers on now there are a lot of chords that you'll learn as a beginner that you can play with just two fingers but i'm going to challenge you guys and have you play with the other two fingers as well because i know you could do it so let's go ahead and do our ring finger next so our ring finger is going to go on the third fret of the b string so that would go here and then your pinky is going to go on the third fret of the high e string so right next door right there all right so you've got your g chord down and the reason i'm showing you this four finger chord first is because it's one of the most popular chords you'll see it in almost every single song ever so congratulations on already learning one of these harder chords first so once you have your g chord down now you just want to make sure that it sounds right and all we have to do for that is strum our guitar so i'm using a pick if you don't have a pick you can use your thumb if you don't have a thumb you can use one of your nails you know you just make do with what you got but um all you got to do for strumming is that all right so go ahead and make sure your g chord sounds like my g chord [Music] how did that sound hopefully pretty good if you heard some buzzing in there that's probably because you're not pressing down hard enough on your strings so go ahead and just adjust your fingers a little bit and make sure you're pressing down hard enough and on the other end if you have you know white tips on your fingers you might be pressing down a little bit too hard and that's not necessary either so just make sure you're putting an even amount of pressure on these strings and also if you find that your hand's a little bit uncomfortable in this position don't worry i guarantee you 99 of the other people watching this video agree with you and are in the exact same position playing guitar can be a little bit weird because our hands aren't normally in this position so make sure that if your hand starts to feel a little bit strange just to take a break and step away so lots of songs out there use some really complicated strumming patterns but i'm going to show you one that's really easy but super applicable so now all i want you to do is instead of strumming down once we're just gonna do that four times in a row one two three four so go ahead and do that with me ready go one two three four congratulations you just played your very first strumming pattern alright so go ahead and pause this video and practice that four down strum strumming pattern a few more times on your own and then when you're ready we can go into the next part of this lesson so the next thing i feel like beginners struggle with is going to be transitioning chords so right now we've got our g chord laid down but what do you do from there well let me go ahead and show you the next chord i'm going to teach you in this series and i've thought this out very carefully so for the next few lessons we're only going to have to move just a few fingers to play completely different chords case in point let's go ahead and move into our second chord so right now we've got our g chord on and the next chord i want to teach you is so super simple all you want to do is take your middle finger that's on the third fret of the low e string and your pointer finger that's on the second fret of the a string and you're just gonna move each of those fingers down one string all right so now your middle finger is on the third fret of the a string and your pointer finger is on the second fret of the d string did you see that it's a little easy to miss because it's such a small movement but we're just going from this to this one two like an eye doctor one two all right so that's just how simple of a movement we're doing this next chord is our c add 9 chord which is basically a variation of a c chord so to go from our g to rc look at that super simple if you need to go ahead and pause the video and practice switching your fingers back and forth until you feel comfortable with this movement so now we just want to move into strumming with our c add 9 chord and what we're going to do for this is exactly what we did with our g chord we're just going to do four down strums like this one two three four something to keep in mind here is our c add nine chord is a little bit different than our g because we're not going to want to strum this top string here but no worries if you're a beginner and that's a little bit hard for you if you do end up strumming that hole all six strings for cn9 it actually sounds pretty okay so no worries there all right so again i want you to pause this video right now and practice that four down strum with that cadd9 chord until you feel pretty comfortable with it so now let's go ahead and tackle the probably number one thing that most beginners have trouble with which is switching between chords so go ahead and put your g chord back on so remember that's when your middle finger and your index finger are on the top two strings and we're just going to strum down four times one two three four beautiful and now after you've done that four times we want to switch to our c add nine chord so again make sure to move those top two fingers down one string each all right and then the pattern's the same one two three four all right great and then once you've done that you just go back to g so move those two fingers back one two three four then back to c add nine one two three four g two three four switch to c and nine two three four back to g two three four and back so go ahead and hop in [Music] anytime you're ready we're just going back and forth between g and c add nine [Music] one two three four c two three four you got it [Music] do you guys recognize something i think you're playing your very first song right now [Music] don't believe me watch this has its own three rows we are never ever ever getting back together we are [Music] ugly people i don't see what anyone can [Music] [Applause] see hey congratulations to the five of you who made it to the end of
