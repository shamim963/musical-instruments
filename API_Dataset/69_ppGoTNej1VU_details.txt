    "Transcript": "if you want to use your guitar to play a beautiful chord progression along with a melody and some Rhythm you should definitely get into finger style guitar foreign [Music] such a confusing term finger style used to describe a technique that has also become a music style Tommy manoli's finger style guitar player but so is Joe Pass Mark Knopfler and Paco de Lucia four guitar players playing completely different style all using finger Style [Music] the finger style guitar is the technique of playing guitar by plucking the strings directly with your fingernails or fingertips so I got used to playing guitar with fingernails I started when I was 10 but you can pluck the strings with the flashy side of your fingers so you can become a finger style player without growing nails now in this lesson I'm going to be using a classical guitar but I also play the example on the acoustic guitar because I want to show you the difference in sound when placing noun strings versus steel strings now most finger style players pluck the strings with the thumb index middle and ring finger leaving out the pinky and the most popular finger picking pattern is called Pima or t123 Pima stands for thumb index middle and ring most of the time the thumb takes care of the bottom three strings so sixth Fifth and fourth string while the index middle and ring finger takes care of the third second and first string and so with Pima we can play a simple C major chord with a beautiful arpeggio like this [Music] now just a bunch of rules with the thumb you're going to pluck the strings downwards while with the index million ring you pluck the strings upwards for this reason you want to have the thumb in front of the index finger so you have space to plug and you want to have the index finger in front of the middle finger and the middle finger in front of the ring finger so keep your plucking hand at a 45 degree angle [Music] let's put together a simple chord progression in the key of C major C Major G major a minor G major F major E minor F major and G major now in step one we're going to use the thumb to pluck the bass note of each chord twice so for the c major we're going to plot the root node on the Fret 3. G on Fret 3 on the sixth string a string open and back to G now f on Fret one e sixth open string fret number one friend number three [Music] so the thumb takes care of the low end of the chord now let's use the index middle and ring finger on the third second and first string to add the harmony is to the chord now for the c major chord we're going to play the third second string fret one and the first open string [Music] for the G major chord we're going to play Beautiful G6 so we're gonna add third open string second string for number three and the first open string [Music] for the next chord a minor we're gonna play an A minor seven so we have third open string second string fret one and first open string back to G6 for the F major chord we're gonna play the root note on the fourth string fret number three so we're not going to play the root note here we're gonna simplify the chord fret three third open string second string for number one and first open string so F major seven sauce too E minor we're going to play an E minor seven chord again root note on the fourth string for number two and then we have third open string second string for number three and the first open string [Music] back to the F major seven chord and G6 so will you just practice the chords you can plot the strings simultaneously just select the chord ring out one two three four and one two three four and one two three and one two three four and one two three four and one two three four and one two two three four and one two three four and one next step let's just play the chord progression with the Pima we're gonna play um each pattern twice per chord [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] such a completely different tone if you're looking for a rounded warm tone you can definitely go with noun strings if you're looking for a brighter tone acoustic still strings are absolutely the place to go there are a lot of variations that we can add to this exercise so this is the most simple finger picking pattern it's called Pima [Music] but we can also add more notes to the pattern for example we could play thumb index middle ring and then thumb ring middle index so we add a variation [Music] in this case I'm developing two finger picking patterns thumb index million ring and thumb ring middle and index [Music] and of course next step we can add a simple Melody to the chord progression [Music] thank you [Music] in this case we are adding a simple Melody on every other chord so C major [Music] and then for the G we add this melody so I play the bass third string second string first string open fret number one zero second string for number three and fret number one [Music] in this case though we are actually changing the finger picking path and so when I play the melody on the G chord I'm using the alternate placking technique so I will have thumb index middle index middle index middle and index now a minor seven with Pima and G6 with alternate plucking and Melody [Music] now F major seven Pima and E minor 7 with the melody back to the F major seven [Music] and G6 with the melody [Music] the melody is always the same is always played with the same notes this is the melody on a classical guitar [Music] one thing that I love about the arpeggio Pima is how versatile it is and the incredible amount of variations that we can create with this simple pattern for example we can plug the strings simultaneously [Music] thank you foreign [Music] two strings simultaneously like this [Music] [Music] beautiful and simple exercise let me know which sound is your favorite do you like nylon strings or steel strings I hope you enjoyed this lesson guys I'm Gonna Leave You to practice this lovely finger picking pattern take it step by step enjoy this lesson and I'll see you next time"
