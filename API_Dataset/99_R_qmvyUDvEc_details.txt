    "Transcript": "hi guys my name's Andy and in this lesson I'm taking you through the seven basic open chords and these should be the first chords that you learn if you're learning guitar for the first time or maybe if it's the first time in a long time these chords are in the same order as I teach them in my free beginners course available at andig guitar. co.uk where we've got heaps of real song lessons taking you from an absolute beginner going right through to having a repertoire that you would be proud to play in front of your friends now we're going to start off with the E major chord this is the first chord that I would teach any of my beginner students if they were in a private lesson and I'm going to show you where to put your fingers for each one of these chords so we're going to have your first finger in the area of the first fret which is this area here on the third string which is 1 2 3 right there and then we're going to have your middle finger on the second fret of the fifth string and we're numbering the strings from bottom to top so 1 two 3 four five right here and then your third finger needs to squash in directly underneath your middle one like this at the same fret but that's on the fourth string and then if we press down with your fingers tips at a 90° angle and we leave plenty of space here so that we're not touching the bottom of the guitar that should ring out really great now these chords are called open chords because they include open strings so we need to make sure that these open strings specifically these thinnest two are ringing out by not touching them with the underneath of your first finger or the palm of your hand [Music] here it's really important that you get this first chord in really good form cuz it sets you up to be able to do all the rest of these chords which we're going to learn from this e because our second chord is the a chord and I'm going to change from it by doing this this is our a major chord now what we did was when we were on the first chord we keep our first finger down and we're going to call that our anchor finger and we're going to slide that just over the metal strip that goes down over that metal threet but keeping on the same string so it never actually lifts off and we're going to move your middle finger just above at the same fret but on the the string directly above and then your third finger goes directly below that string which your first finger is on so essentially we've got one 2 three if we're learning this chord aresh now of course this is the second chord we've done we actually want to strum it from the fifth string here from the next string down and that makes sure that we've got the lowest note as an a because this is the a chord now these first two chords are in line with level one of my beginner's course and that level is all about mastering the change between the E and the a by keeping that first finger down and sliding over the next chord we're going to learn is the D chord so this cord again we can keep our first finger exactly where it is at the same fret but it would be great if we could move it this way just a little bit cuz when we're at this side of the Fret everything rings out a little sweeter than it does at this side of the Fret everything sounds better when we're just here and this is our D chord a very bright happy sounding chord and we have your first finger again where I said before we've got your middle finger on the second fr fret of the first string and then we make a little triangle shape by having our third finger or the third fret of the second string here so one two and three and then we strum from the third string from the thickest one because that is the open D string so e a d and then our first three chords nice and logical to check that these chords are ringing out great you'll want to do a strum with them and then pick each individual string and then do a final strum so strum pick and strum that way we're checking that there are no strings that sound a little bit like this okay so if we've got any strings here that aren't ringing out for you a great tip is to make sure you're on the tips of your fingers you want to be right at 90° angle Le and you want to make sure that none of your fingers are hitting the string underneath and we allowing a little bit of room as I say not touching the bottom of your guitar and it's E A and D chords the make up level two of my beginner's course the next chord we're going to go for is a G major chord and it's played like this now there's a couple of variations of this G chord I call this a big G it can also be played like this but I find it's best in the context that we're going to use it with the songs that you'll want to learn with these open chords that we go for the four fingered G chord which is also called a big G because it's easier to change to the D chord which is a really common change G to a d by keeping that third finger down so we've got the the G chord which is the new one and then the D chord you can see that third finger is now the anchor and in fact we can go from all these four chords 4 3 2 1 and we never actually lifted off all of our fingers from the fretboard we've always got one finger down we've always got that contact on the fretboard which I think is really important and really helps your changes so for our g-cord we have your first finger at second fret of the Fist middle finger third fret of the sixth string the thickest one and then it's a bit more of a stretch for your third and Little Finger which are both at the third fret of the thinnest two strings the middle two strings are open so we want to make sure that they ring out and that you haven't accidentally got a finger on them remember to stay on your tips and this G chord makes up level three of my free beginner's course which also includes the D chord and the a chord it works between those changes so that's our first four chords which are major chords these are happy sounding chords but can be summarized by saying just the G chord for example we don't have to say G major all the time but the next two chords we're covering are minor chords now these are sad sounding chords and if music is an expression of emotion we kind of need the happy and the sad and it's the mix that makes things sound really good and these chords are actually if anything a little bit easier than a couple of the other ones the first one of which is probably the easiest this is the E minor chord which I encourage you to play with your first two fingers so we have your first finger at the fifth fret of the second string and then your middle finger directly underneath it leaving the thickest E string because again this is the E chord [Music] you can play it with other fingering so your middle two fingers but I prefer your first two fingers then we've got an anchor finger between the G and that E minor so again we can go through all our chords and not have to take off all your fingers the next one is the a minor and this is the chord now this one's so easy because it's actually the same shape as the first chord that we learned which was the E major so this is our E major chord but get this if you move this down a string it's suddenly a whole of a different chord and it sounds sad and remember we want to strum from our open a string and not strum that thickest e note because this is an a chord so we still strum from that open a string there aren't too many songs that use just minor chords but there are a few and they make up level four of my beginner's course the final chord we're going to go for in this lesson is a C major chord now this was actually the first chord that my older brother taught me when I was around 9 or 10 and it's a little bit more of a stretch so it's not ideal for an absolute beginner but it is really commonly used and this is our C major chord so we got two fingers where the word actually on the a minor chord first finger first fret of the second string middle finger on the fourth string second fret and third finger bit of a stretch third fret of the fifth string so we have one 2 3 give it a strum pick each individual string and strum again now a great thing to remember with this c chord in particular which can be quite tricky for a lot of people is to have your fingers on this angle so if you're going for this cord and plenty of others and have your fingers vertical along with the Frets so in line with the Frets going down you're going to find it a real struggle it's going to be a real stretch for your hand which will feel very unnatural for you now if we put our hands on this angle so everything all your fingers are basically curled up and pointing towards yourself um you'll find it a much more comfortable grip for your hand and it can in time become second nature that chord again 1 2 3 and this is our c chord which we would strum from string five all the way down so if you were able to follow that video and play each one of those Cordes as we went through them then you've done a really great job I really can't that that's really fantastic um no matter if you found that an easy or a difficult exercise um the actual test for this and the way you want to practice it is exactly the same and it comes down to the changes between the chords as well as just learning each one of them in turn remembering the names of so forth but the real trick to nailing these cords is getting your fingers to remember where to go more instinctively having that muscle memory and being able to get the changes between the chords not just the chords themselves so every one of those chords as I say we can change through them by keeping one finger down as we go there's the E chord we keep our first finger down and change to the a we keep our first finger down again and change to the D we keep our third finger down this time and we change to the G we keep the first finger down and change to E minor we keep the middle finger down and change to a [Music] minor and we keep the first two fingers down to change to the C chord so we were able to get through all seven chords without having to lift off all your fingers at once now that is a way more you know Advanced exercise than you want to be going for if you still trying to remember all the basic cord names but this video is something that you can always refer back to and try and see where you are with that exercise cuz it's really when you're able to do that that you can go for songs with all those chords in them if you find that you can only manage say the E A and the D and all the others you forget where to put your fingers or you forget what the cord's called or the changes aren't quite there yet everything's not quite ringing out then you know to go for songs that just have E A and D in it and then practice the chords themselves until you're ready until your fingers have memorized those shapes and they're ringing out great so at each stage when I went through those chords there we have those levels of my beginners course and you know where to go from this video basically I hope that's something you've enjoyed and I really do wish you many years of guitar playing fun thanks for watching please subscribe here if you you like what I'm doing and I'm sure I'll see you again bye for now [Music] [Music]"
