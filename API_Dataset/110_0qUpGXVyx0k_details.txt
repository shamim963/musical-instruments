    "Transcript": "if I tell you something will you promise me that you'll never tell another Soul not even your own parents or your children this song birds of a feather which is by Billy ish with Phineas the human being who is also related to Billy ish is pretty easy don't tell anybody also I promised my dogs I was going to take them on a walk in like 10 minutes so we have to get through the song super fast otherwise my dogs are going to know that I'm a liar I am a liar they're just going to know it up until now I've been able to keep it a secret from them just like you're going to keep this secret from your parents remember don't tell your parents or your children that this song is easy on a scale from 1 to 10 how would you rate the start of this guitar tutorial standard tuning no capo please place your pointer finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom and put your ring finger or actually wait a minute hang on yeah whatever I don't care ring finger fifth threat on the bottom string so you're like this I thought I was going to burp didn't happen guys please play the second string from the bottom then play the bottom string and then go right back to the second string from the bottom then go to the second fret on the second string from the bottom then play five on the bottom string with your pinky and then go back to the second fret on the second string from the bottom so that was like this look 3 five 3 2 5 2 do it again 1 2 3 again 3 five 3 2 5 3 again 3 5 3 2 5 three that's what I would like to call the main riff for the song that like goes on I think throughout the entire song So if you wanted to just keep playing that you could but I think that would get extremely boring how about for the introduction to the song we play that riff twice through let's practice it right now full speed 1 2 3 4 great now we're going to switch to some chords this is where the singing starts and we're going to play some chords start off with the D chord middle finger second fret bottom string ring finger third fret second string from the bottom point wi finger second fret third string from the bottom it's like a little triangle I've always thought of the D chord as a triangle but sometimes when I tell their people they're like what are you talking about now I'm not talking about random people at the grocery store hey uh excuse me I'm just going to get in line behind you did you know the decord is a triangle this feels like a stupid path that I should not go down I should just stick to teaching the song in the comments section of this video do you think the decord is like a triangle also when you get in line at the grocer store you go hey I'm just going to get in line behind you I don't think I've ever done that in my I probably have done that it seems like the sort of thing I would do okay so you got the D chord don't play the top string just strum the bottom like honestly we'd really love to just play the bottom four strings and you're just going to go strum 2 3 4 then we're going to go to a B minor chord yes it's true this is a bar chord but I will also show you a non-bar chord way to play it let's do the bar chord way first with your pointer finger play two on the second string from the top and mash down on the bottom five strings keep your thumb behind the neck of the guitar pinch these two fingers together you guys know it I have a whole entire barcord video course for free at Marin music.com go to Marin music.com Link in the description and watch the bar chord course for free and then once your pointer fingers there put your middle finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom put your ring finger on the fourth fret of the third string from the top this is a B minor seven bar chord I think I said just to play a B minor but we're not going to do a B minor we're going to do a B minor 7 which is this and you start the bottom five strings 1 2 3 4 great then we're going to go to an E minor so right I told you I would teach you the non-bar chord way to play it here's the nonar chord way to play a B minor 7 uh put your middle finger on two of the second string from the top put your ring finger on two of the the third string from the bottom put your pinky on two of the bottom string play the bottom five strings see it doesn't sound quite as good B minor 7 bar chord B minor 7 not bar chord but it's fine so choose your poison pick your poison choose your enemies never look twice always cross the road the streams are for breaking rules are for closing guys I'm in a bad mood after the B minor 7 chord we're going to go to an E minor 7 top string is over put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top middle finger second fret third string from the top put your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom strum all six strings 1 2 3 4 then we're going to go to an A7 sus chord here's what you do you just get rid of your pointer finger keep these two here so middle fingers on two of the third string from the top ring fingers on three of the second string from the bottom mute the top string I use my thumb to mute the top string I just touch it and mute it strum this A7 sus chord one two for two beats then just slide your ring finger over from the third fret into the second fret this is an A7 chord strum this for two beats guys we've just learned the main chords to the song it just goes d234 B minor 7234 either way you play it E minor 7 2 3 4 and then A7 sus and then a seven one two here we go birds of a feather they're always my friends birds of a feather we never will die birds of a feather I'm friends with you birds of a feather what rhymes with poo I guys there's no other word I could say other than poo there so for the verse you just do that twice through that's the verse then we go to the chorus the chorus is actually the exact same chords again what I do for the chorus cuz if you have all the production of like the drums and keyboard and stuff you know you can just keep playing the exact same thing on guitar and it's fine but if you're playing this song like an open microphone or you're playing for your friends or whatever you're just trying to record a cover of it you probably want to change the rhythm of the strumming for the chorus just to add a little more energy what I do for the chorus is I do the exact same chords but I just strum down down down down down down down down for each chord well no that's not true I strum eight times for the D eight times for the B minor 7 eight times for the E minor 7 and then four times for as suus four times for A7 let's try that so this is the chorus where we're just thring down down down down on each chord one two here we go d 2 3 4 5 6 switch cords 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 switch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 switch 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 then you do it again keep it going go to the B7 switch to the E minor 7 cord then go to the A7 sus A7 great after so you just do it twice like that for the chorus then there's like a post chorus section right after the chorus you just go back to the [Music] Riff and you play the Riff eight times through then we go to the second verse which is exactly the same as the first CH verse then we go to the second chorus which is exactly the same as the first chorus then we go to that post chorus section where we play the Riff another eight times then we've made it to the ending of the song for the ending you just play the chorus all the way through again so just the D B minor 7 E minor 7 a so A7 going down down down down down down down down on each chord you go all the way through that then you just go back to the Riff play the Riff another like four times and then end it on the second fret here look we [Music] go here comes the end get ready [Music] and it ends like that right there on the second fret I got to go take my dogs on a walk [Music] now gang gang"
