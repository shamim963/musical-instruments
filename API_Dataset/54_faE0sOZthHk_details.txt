    "Transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] to you by Mazzy Star don't worry I'm not gonna don't worry I'm not gonna be mad and yelling the whole time I might be I'm gonna try not to be this song is simple but it doesn't mean it's easy this guys it's time we mastered this B minor bar chord right to die today in this episode of the show I will I will show you how to play the B minor chord and I'm gonna make you feel good about it maybe it's you're gonna have to do a lot of work first it's look we need to start with an a chord we're in standard tuning by the way no capo standard tuning we gotta learn this a chord you might already know it uh the the top string you're not gonna push on it the second string from the top you are also not going to push on that one but take your middle finger put it on the second fret of the third string from the top take your ring finger put it on the second fret of the third string from the bottom take your pinky put it on the second fret of the second string from the bottom bottom string it's just gonna be open if you can and I believe you can take your thumb bring it up over the top of the neck and just touch the top string mute that top string we don't want it to be a part of this situation the a chord should sound like this [Music] okay we did it if it doesn't sound like that that means you're out of tune or your fingers are in the wrong place or something else terrible is happening on this a chord let's learn the basic strumming that will continue throughout the entire song we want to go like this we want to strum down down up down up down down up down up down up so that was down down up down up down down up down up you must do it like that I mean I'm not I don't actually have the right to tell you what you must do but if you want it to sound like the song this is what you've let's not mince words I think you should do it this way please if you don't mind I mean it's fine you can do whatever you want so don't go down up down up down that's not what I said it's down down up down up down down up down up I would say this song is in six eight time and what that means is we're gonna count it like one two three four five six one two three four five six now so let's just do that strumming pattern medium speed on the a chord like four times in a row just just to see what happens one two three here we go down down down down that was so good it's time for us to learn the second chord which is an E chord an E chord not to be confused with Igor it was like Frankenstein's assistant I believe uh top string is open get your thumb away if you just take your thumb and just kind of hinge it up get it out of the way put your middle finger on the second fret of the second string from the top put your ring finger on the second fret of the third string from the top take your pointer finger put it on the first fret of the third string From The Bottom the classic E chord guys same exact strumming on this one you go down down up down do we dare put these two chords together let's give it a try so we're gonna do a and then we're gonna switch to the E you gotta move all your fingers unfortunately but I think you can handle it also I have a little tip for you but it's only sort of helpful it's sort of just confusing one two three tip after we play it foreign [Music] so the tip wasn't very good I don't even follow this tip so I don't recommend you do it but when you're playing the a chord if you would like you can put your pointer finger on the first fret of the third string from the bottom to get it ready where when you switched it to e so see how I've got the a chord pointer fingers right there when I switch to e boom I don't have to move my pointer finger I wouldn't do it though I think it's a bad idea don't know why I'm telling you to do that let's play those two chords again so just a to the e one two three here we go [Music] are we really supposed to switch from the a to the E lightning fast like that well you're supposed to switch pretty quickly but let me give you this tiny little tool that is one of the most crucial strumming tools and tips and skills you could possibly have which is which is as follows as you're strumming down down up down up when we're getting ready to switch did you did you see what just happened that was I was very sneaky what I just did on my very last strum up of the a chord I actually lifted up my fingers and started getting ready for the E chord as I strummed up so if I slow it way down I'm going down down up down up down down up down open and down on the so on that last drum up of the a releasing my fingers and then I have a head start on getting ready for the E chord let's try that together very slowly just going from a to the E we're gonna try to get that open I'll probably yell out open as we're switching to the E chord so you know exactly when to do it open means let go your fingers you can't let go of your fingers you know what I mean one two three here we go open it's nice and soothing when I just scream that out in the middle of the song let's do it one more time one two three here we go down down lift lift is better I like lift better it has more of a pleasant sound to it and it's one syllable which makes it much easier if we do it up to speed I'm not expecting you to be able to do it up to speed yet but just so you can see how it sounds it goes like this one two three four five six I'm gonna do that again so you can catch my little open things sneaks in there one New River foreign you get it okay this is the this is a terrible part of the song this is where it goes to the B minor so let's just let's forget about the A and the E for a second we'll put those aside and we're gonna learn the B minor bar chord don't please please don't give up like try it it's gonna set this chord okay put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top put your ring finger on the fourth fret of the third string from the top a little bit of a stretch not too bad if your thumb is up here over the top it's gonna be very tough to do that so for this chord for this B minor bring your thumb back here I'm like behind the neck it's like I feel like I'm pinching my thumb into my pointer finger together with the neck of the guitar in between pointer finger on second fret of the second string for the top ring finger fourth fret on the third string from the top pinky fourth fret on the third string from the bottom middle finger third fret on the second string from the bottom again reminding you bring your thumb back here so you're kind of like that and then the part that we all hate take your pointer finger and mash it down so the tip I'm pushing on that second fret of the second string from the top but with like this knuckle right here I'm really pushing down I'm really trying to push on the bottom string is what I'm doing I'm trying to get that knuckle just push on the bottom string and that's the bar chord part where I have that finger I don't know if this is actually what it means but I always think of it like the bar chord because this finger just turns into a bar that's I'm mashing down on everything like a metal bar like a two by four that's not a bar that's a beam once they call them beam chords uh also another helpful thing the very tip of your pointer finger should just be poking up and touching the top string we just want to mute that top string so don't Smash down on the top string Smash down on the second string from the top and everything below it but just touch the top string this is our B minor chord let's strum it once and see how it sounds okay now rest your hand rest your hand if you're all super used to Bar chords then I'm driving you super crazy right now but if you're not used to Barre chords this is this is good this is good stay stay with me here we're gonna make some progress here okay my thumb my thumb right here hurts okay let's get the cord ready again pointer finger second fret second string from the top ring finger fourth fret third string from the top pinky fourth fret third string from the bottom middle finger third fret second string for the bottom pointer finger smashing down on the bottom five strings another little helpful thing your ring finger and your pinky have them touching if they are separated like this you're probably gonna get some really bad sounding notes in there pretend that the nail of your pinky is super glued to the back of your ring finger like that just push push those together like that and then those go together it's almost like one giant finger it's like a double finger there's a B minor okay okay let's try the strumming on this chord and see how it goes down down up down up here we go [Music] all right take another rest another rest for your fingers do I have any other tips I want to share right now siren outside and I don't mean like a mermaid siren I mean like like a ambulance police fire truck type siren man I hope mermaid back accident mermaid accident as we continue practicing this B minor bar chord I know I know it probably sounds bad right now if it sounds like this right now that's okay just keep trying it's gonna it's gonna take some time you're not gonna get it in like the three minutes we've been practicing it it's gonna take you a little while but as an extra little thing to practice I can't there's something they do live and the loud live videos of magic star playing this song you could you could hear it but in the in the studio recording I can't quite hear but I like it so I'm gonna show it to you they go like this on the B minor they go four five six thank you you see what that was that was I did the down down up down up down down up down up I did that whole thing then I got rid of my middle finger and just my middle finger has to go somewhere so my middle finger smashes down on my pointer finger to help it out and I do the down down up down up without my middle finger pushing on that second to bottom string then I just put it right back onto that third fret for the last down down up down up so the whole B minor goes like this regular regular no middle finger back to regular let's practice that a few more times gives you a little something to distract your brain from how much you hate this B minor chord here we go one two three here we go down down down up down up get rid of it put it back let's do that one more time one two three here we go down down up regular get rid of your middle finger put it back all right we've done enough B minor practice now that I think it's time that we practice getting from the A and the e to the B minor that's going to be brutal but remember remember that trick I showed you with going from a to E I said that on the last strum of the a you play the open strings right before you switch to e we're gonna do that same thing big time going from the e to the B minor so check this out from the E chord I'm going down down up down up down down up down lift B minor did that lift or lift it up let's let's do that like crazy slow together starting from the E chord I'm gonna say lift and then we have to get as close to the B minor as we can one two three start from e down down up down up down down up down lift B minor oh one more time one two three even slower down down up down up down down up down lift B minor I'm I'm acting like we're doing it super slow and it's like oh this is so slow you have plenty of time even though we're going a fraction of the speed of the actual song we still have almost no time to get that B minor so here's what I'm gonna recommend you practice I'm gonna recommend you just practice going e down up down lift B minor then again e down up down lift B minor just practice just that tiny little fraction of the song as many times as you possibly can because do you know what's not gonna do you much good going like this if you go it's time to practice Fade Into You by Mazzy Star and then you go like this [Music] [Music] you're just training your hands to take as long as they want getting into the B minor focus in on that transition into the B minor [Music] ghost go take it very slowly do it a bajillion times all right should we play this whole thing I think I've talked about the B minor enough I am going to do that little middle finger thing on the B minor we're gonna play the whole through play through the whole thing two times one two three here we go [Music] foreign [Music] that's the that's the main thing the mostly you just gotta play that B minor a bunch I just hit myself in the chin with my guitar but there's one little different part with the with the chords in the chorus so in the chorus they add one D chord in there here's what they do okay you know you get to the chorus because that's when the singer sings Fade Into You So that means you're in the chorus great in the chorus they do our regular chords once then they do the regular chords twice then the third time that they play the regular chords they don't do the regular chords they do something a little bit different you know it's the third time because it's it's when she sings Fade Into You a second time this is so confusing look in the chorus you go like this you go [Music] you still go to the B minor but you just do it once then you go to D D FYI TMI BTW is middle finger second fret bottom string ring finger third fret second string from the bottom pointer finger second fret third string from the bottom and then your thumb comes up over the top and mutes the top string so just to make that confusing explanation even more confusing when we get to the chorus we do the regular chords once we do the regular chords twice we play the chords with the D at the end once then we do the regular chords one more time and that's the chorus to the song oh look what I brought this is a mistake this part's gonna be bad foreign you can just go like this [Music] this is a solo guys here's what it is and they're going up to 14. on the second to bottom string and then it plays 14 14 on the two strings above it it's like you slide up to 14 and then you let that note sit there for a second then go 14 14 on the two strings above it that was terrible then you slide up to nine on the second string from the bottom and play nine on the two strings about it so it's wrangling bone then you're gonna play 999 slide down to seven and then you can do that again or you can bend the seven and then bring it back or if you're using a slide this is the main reason the only reason I'm even talking about the solo part is because I have a little slide tip for you if you're using a slide I have a glass one the metal ones are good I don't care brass Chrome if you're using the slide here's the tip I took me way too many years to learn this it's what I was this many years today old when I learned that when you're playing with the slide don't just have the slot well first of all the big one with the slide don't push on the strings you don't want to push you just want to touch the strings with the slide the other tip though the most important one don't just have the slide touching the strings have your pointer or whatever fingers are on this side of the side Slide the the left side of the slide have those fingers lay down and gently touch the strings if you're going like this you get a bunch of extra noise but if you have these two fingers resting here oh it's so much cleaner do you know why I use a little vibrato thing but you know why you wiggle back and forth with the slide partly because it sounds cool but also because then you don't have to be exactly 100 in tune using the slide kind of sucks I'm not sure if you can tell but I'm kind of like not really telling you anything I'm just kind of talk I'm just kind of talking I don't know what this is I'm going up to 14. then I slide down to nine and then I go [Music] foreign I'm like a slide Master pretty much [Music]"
