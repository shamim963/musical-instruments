    "Transcript": "hi let's learn how to play Hotel California on our guitars throughout the video you'll see different modifications for people who are just starting off and I'm also going to give you a few tips on how to be more advanced with the piece so let's get started let's do the chords on the first verse just give me one down Strom and then breathe for three beats this is how we're going to do it one 2 3 one two like this okay let's go one two three D go now one 2 3 we're just warming up two 3 4 One 2 3 4 One 2 3 4 if that's struming pattern felt pretty simple for you then I'm going to give you one that's a little more advanced it's going to be down down down down up and then do it again with the same chord down down down down up then we switch let's try it one two ready go now down down down down up down switch now down down up down down switch down down down down down down switch down down down down up down down down now I'm going to give you another string pattern that sounds a little bit more like the essence of this song and it sounds like this I'll break it down in a second but I want to get it in your ear first I'm going to play it with the next chord I'm next now I'm going to say it if you can say it you'll be able to play it ready go down down up up down down up down up next chord ready go down down up up down down up down up so now let me break down this strumming pattern so that anybody at any level can do it first let's go to the a minor and give me down down and make sure there's a little space between them don't get me down down no down down notice that little pause that's important ready go down down again go down down now I'd like down down up down down up there's a slight hesitation there ready go down down up again go down down up again go down down up last time go down down up now we're going to do another up down down up up down actually let's add that final down it feels more natural ready go down down up up down again go now down down up up down if that stumbled you clap it down down up up down again go down down up up down because if you can say it and feel it you'll be able to strum it again go now down down up up down try not to play it this time just listen listen ready and listen again listen only this time watch my strumming hand only watch my strumming hand okay let's do it let's do it one two ready go now the final part of this strum is quite easy it's just down up down up give me that just the down up down ready go down up down up down up down up do that a few times down up down up play with [Music] joy breathe and release any tension you might be holding on the shoulders remember this is we're we're doing this for fun right so the full strumming pattern again sounds like this down down up up down down up down up now if you'd like this in printed form I'm I'm going to add a link down below there's a PDF you can download for this here's my recommendation the storming pattern if it's St making you stumble um write it down and practice it like when you're watching TV if you're on a bus if you're on the train if you anytime you have any kind of moment where you can practice something random just do it in the air do it on your seat belt do it on your shirt down down up up down down up down up down down up up down down up down up and this motion you'll be able to bring to the guitar if you're stumbling on the strumming pattern and for today just do the other strumming pattern the down down down down down down down it sounds beautiful okay so I purposely avoided a section of the verse so we let's play through it let's play through part of the verse here we go from the top a minor and I'll show you which part I've been avoiding one two red ready go now down down up up down down up down up down down up up down down up down up down down up up down down up down up down down up up down down up down up so let's do a simplified F you're going to ignore the strings that are closest to your face string six and five don't play those don't strum those don't hold those because normally that f is the full range right and for me it comes out when I just hold it but switching into it it's like a gamble so here's one that works better for me starting on string four you play Frets three two one one let me get closer 3 2 one one the index finger I'm going to do it backwards I'm going to go from strings one and two you that with your index and then you're going to staircase down staircase down so one one two three if you're thinking from strings one to four and you're just going to strum on those that you're pressing that's an F that's an F so you're going to do down down up up down down up down up or the simplified strumming pattern down down down down up down down down down and then you go to the C chord after that down down down down down down down down let's try the F and the C I'll do the simpler strumming pattern for right now later on I'll do a playthrough with both struming patterns one two ready go now down down down down c chord [Music] now okay breathe breathe breathe breathe if you're getting a little frustrated right now that's okay that happens if that's you give me just a single down strum and count to four one 2 3 4 and one 2 three 4 and that'll sound just as beautiful and when you listen to the original piece there are many moments where it almost sounds like the guitar is just doing one single downst and letting the notes ring so we are still being authentic to the piece so let's do the last uh four chords there from the f one two ready go now one two 3 c chord 1 2 D Minor press the wrong string ignore me ready and I messed that one up I messed that one up let's do it again for me for me one two Focus ready go now I'm saying Focus for me C D Minor [Music] E7 okay take a breath remind your face that you're not mad let's do the whole verse you can do it in any strumming pattern that you choose I'm going to do it with single strums first and we'll play this the the verse several times and the chords in the verse the pattern repeats itself on other verses so we are learning all the verses at once here we go one two ready go now one two 3 four breathe 2 three 4 two next C now two next chord now two three four and one 2 three four and one two 3 ready go two three four okay now I'm going to do the next strumming pattern down down down down up down little tip uh sometimes when we're excited about a piece we do this we make our strumming hand really wide bring that down and be more delicate with [Music] this there is a time for being louder especially with this song but it happens later you don't want to give it all away in the beginning you want to build into it and if you start up here there's nowhere left to go so start here here we go one two one two less is more down down down Swit play with joy [Music] breathe if you're stumbling jumping into the f chord then my recommendation is after you've played the D like the the chord right before the f look at your fretboard so you're going to do [Music] G and then D at this point look at your fretboard don't look up at the screen look at your fret board and land that index finger first and then the other fingers sometimes as beginners we will stop the strum until all the fingers have landed but the pros don't do this the pros they keep the strumming hand because it's like a clock and if we stop the strumming the song St stops so keep the hand going now I'm going to do it with the most challenging of the struming patterns um but you can still play any of the other struming patterns or make up your own as you're doing this okay here we go one two one two I'm ready go now [Music] nice so let's do a little quick pause here so if you're enjoying the lesson so far and you would like to help the Channel please either hit the like button or press the share button share it on um one of your pages or email it to a friend or leave a comment and let me know which string pattern you're playing so far and if you're making up one on your own let me know what that is in the comments any engagement with the video really helps it to perform better and helps keep the channel going so thank you now we have arrived at the chorus and the first four chords that we need are F then C E7 a minor let's do those four in time one two ready go one two three switch now remember to breathe switch now to three four and good good good okay now add a storming pattern it can be the simpler one or the more advanced one here we go one two ready go now to the Hotel California what a lovely place what a lovely face good let's do it one more time just for fun one two ready welcome to theel what a lovely place what a lovely face I'm going to keep [Music] going a nice any of you can find it here excuse some errors there okay so um let's analyze the chords in this course we have f c E7 a minor if you notice in the verse that F and the C are always around each other same with the E7 and the a minor so that's nice to see next we have another FC repeating and then we end with a D minor and an e seven and that's exactly how we ended the verse so it's nice to see that we have um some pattern here and pattern you don't necessarily have to memorize the piece if you don't want to but if you need those moments to look at your fretboard it's nice to know what is the chord that's coming next okay so let's play through the chorus one two ready go now f [Music] C [Music] E7 a minor back to [Music] Echo C D Minor E7 down down down down up down and you can have those moments where you just do single strums and let the guitar ring for you um so I think it would be so cool if we did the chords for a verse and then the chorus together so the thing that we'll have to learn how to transition to is from an E7 which is the end of the verse to an F so try that right now take a few seconds to try E7 F E7 F and memorize that and if all of this is feeling really easy for you then maybe it's time to start trying the full bar F and if it feels uncomfortable to try it at the very top um bring it down a few Frets it won't be an F but it'll help you to learn the shape and then work your way [Music] down and then switch into it cuz that's where the magic Is Right learning how to switch into it all right let's do a verse and let's go into the chorus the verse one two one two ready go E7 g d think ahead F chord ready go C D minor E7 get ready for an F for the chorus ready Welcome to [Music] California what a lovely place a lovely Place [Music] face up the hotel Califoria of [Music] totally switched up the lyrics there but hopefully it uh felt like a good practice of the song to do the verse and the course together if you want to play along with the recording of the song you'll need a capo on your guitar and if you want to do an outro it would just be the same chords in the verse so just for fun let's play a verse and of course again here we go one two one two ready [Music] go [Music] breath chorus ready [Music] go wrap it [Music] up and on an a minor if you enjoyed this tutorial and you would like to support
