hi guys welcome to day three of my 10day guitar starter course where we're checking out the easy three Chord song Three Little Birds by Bob Marley so we've already covered the chords needed to play this song the E the a chord and the D chord if you haven't checked out those chords yet please do check out day one or two of this course where we'll cover those chords in depth and let's get straight in for the closeup now for how to play Three Little Birds by Bob Marley so the chorus of this song should be very easy for most of you guys watching this video we want to change between the a chord and the D chord so very similar to what we did in day two of this 10day guitar starter course we just have the E major chord in the verse but the chorus so this first chord sequence is two bars of the a chord and if I just strummed on the beat that would go 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 then we change to the D and then back to a bar of a so two A's one bar of d one bar of a just a demo first of all don't worry about a thing cuz every little thing is going to be all right and that repeats twice and then we get on to a verse let's try with this one cuz it is very similar to what we did in day two let's try doing something we call eighth strumming and we're going to do this all with down strum so essentially for one bar rather than strumming four times we're going to strum eight and twice as fast that looks like this that's how we split the bar up now one and two and three and four and because we have to in music we can't just count to eight we have to always count to four and count the offbeats As and so one and two and three and four and one bar of a would therefore sound like 1 and 2 and three and four and so because this should be fairly easy for you let's go straight for this harder strum and get stuck into this easy song and if you want to play along with me I will shout out the changes for you but we're strumming it around this Tempo one and two and three and four and so ready on our air chord everyone let's give this a go in two and three and four 1 and 2 and three and about a thing two change to the D C every little two and three back to an a chord two and three and four and let's have one more go at that same line cuz it happens twice for this chorus three and four don't worry two and three and about a thing and two and three and D cuz every little thing back to an a a and two and three and four and now we need that to happen twice straight away on the bounce if the change was a little hard to you just pause the video briefly to do some individual changes struming the a chord changing to the D give it a strum change back to the a if you're unfamiliar with this change check out day two where I explain how to play these chords in depth and why we're playing this version of an a rather than the three in a line a that some of you may be more familiar with the idea is this anchor finger basically so let's go for this one more time we're basically going for the same line again but we're going straight for both lines and I'll kind of sing the chorus so you get an idea of how it all fits together then we'll learn the verse so same again two and three and four don't worry two and three about a thing and two and three to a d chord every little thing back to an a chord there and two we stay on the a don't worry two and three and four a thing and two and three to a d Cur every little thing back to an A and two and three and four and perfect that is how to play the chorus we then have a verse which is this next section I'm about to show you and then we go back to a chorus typical song structure usually starts with a verse then goes to Chorus Verse Chorus but this one starts straight away with the chorus which is why we did that first the verse a little bit trickier because we do also change to this E chord but we're going to start off with the a I'll just give you a little demo of it first rise up this morning smile with the Rising Sun three little AC cords then to a d chord so that's the first line the second line is really similar but we're going to change every chord here is for a bar a e a and d the way I kind of like to think about it with these chord sequences is a chord is kind of in the middle so then we come to the thicker strings go back to the middle and then to D which is on the thinner strings for this one so if you remember middle thicker strings middle then High it can be easier than trying to remember the letter names remember what your fingers are doing to remember a longer chord sequence and it helps you visualize it so let's play this together I'll shout out the chord sequence but it's also on the screen for you if you need it from the a chord straight for eth struming I'm sure you can do this guys keep keep going with me two and three and four and morning smile with the Rising Sun three and 2 and a a chord 2 and three and then a d chord 2 and three and pause there let's go one more time for that one guys really good if you've kept up with that but let's do it one more time to make sure in two and three and rise up this morning E chord E chord 2 and three and a chord there and two and three on my doorstep two and three and four and and then it's almost the same but the D and the a chord are swapped around for the last two bars so it's a bar of a e straight to a d chord and then back to a so it's just the last two chords swapped around it's on the screen for you let's try and go for this straight away from the air chord the second line three and four and E chord pure and true D chord bigger change let's give this a bit more time there we go D chord this is a message to a chord U and then we would be straight into the chorus but we're just going to go for that one one more time so let's go for the whole thing the whole verse I'll shout out each chord as it comes to you and we'll pause a little bit on the changes to make sure everyone can keep up from the a chord top of the verse in two and three and rise up this morning two and three and four E chord Rising Sun and three three little a chord A then to a d on my doorstep two and three back to an a chord second line sweet song with Melodies E chord pure and true D chord this time singing D this is a message to A A and that's the end of our verse so to have a full play through now we want to play through the chorus come to the verse and then end on that chorus and that is absolutely plenty for this song but there is another couple of verses as well if you want to keep that pattern going it's always the same even if the lyrics change in a verse it's the same chord sequency or count is the same let's have a playthrough then full playthrough from the top now I'll sing a little bit but I'll also shout out the chords to make it easy for you join in with me from your a chord straight into a chorus in 1 2 3 and four don't worry 2 3 B stay on the a chord then it's a d go cuz D chord back to an A A 2 3 start again don't worry second line about a thing two and three to a d cuz every little thing it's back to an a back to an a verse rise up this morning two and three smile E chord Rising Sun three a chord Birds two and three then to a d d and two and three singing a chord 2 and 3 4 pure and true 3 D chord this time bigger change is a message to a chord 2 three chorus chorus don't worry two and three and About a Thing 2 3 4 cuz every little thing three and four and 1 and two and three and they tell me don't worry last line now about a thing two and three and D cuz every little thing it's going to be all right two and three and four and so that's how to play Three Little Birds and that is the end of this dear three of this 10day guitar start of course if you haven't checked out days one and two
