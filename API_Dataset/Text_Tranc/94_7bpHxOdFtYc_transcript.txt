i'm going to show you the top four finger picking 
guitar patterns in the travis picking style travis   picking is a finger picking approach named after 
the guitarist merle travis these four patterns are   the most common and most basic finger picking 
guitar patterns to learn you can play them as   they are or you can expand on them in the future 
to play some very advanced sounding finger style   guitar and solo guitar arrangements which is what 
players like chet atkins did these finger picking   patterns are used all over the place in any music 
that has somewhat of a finger picking guitar   sound folk guitar country music singer 
songwriter music the beatles used them   simon and garfunkel bob dylan and tons and tons 
of artists today are using some of these exact   fingerpicking patterns to accompany themselves 
the signature of this travis picking sound is   that one's thumb is constantly alternating bass 
notes keeping a really really consistent sound   going in the bass role and then the fingers are 
filling out the chords with various patterns and   notes on top of that and then melody can even 
be played on top of those two things as well   when you put that all together it creates 
this very appealing fingerpicking guitar   sound because we're playing the role of at least 
two musicians if not three we get this full rich   self-contained kind of full music sound with just 
one instrument i'm going to show you each of the   four finger picking guitar patterns with different 
string groupings because different chords use   different strings i'm going to demonstrate each 
pattern through a common chord progression slowly   and then fast and then i'll also demonstrate 
each finger picking pattern with a section of   a real song so we can hear how it sounds in real 
music that's what we're going to cover let's do it i'm jared borkowski from soundguitarlessons.com 
where i help guitarists gain more creative   control over music so we can express ourselves 
more freely if you're new here welcome please   follow and subscribe i have new videos every week 
okay so the first pattern is called the inside   outside pattern we're gonna use a g chord for 
this and every pattern is named based on what's   happening above the bass because the bass in 
all four patterns is going to be the exact   same so this is the bass line if you're playing 
a g chord it's the one five one five of g okay   so that's just going this alternating base and 
then the inside outside means that you're going   to play out of these two notes the third string 
and the second string the inside note and then   the outside tone it's just very simple alternating 
between those you have base inside base outside   base inside base outside that's it as simple 
as it is inside outside pattern this is on g   quick side note here don't ever put fingers 
down with the left hand that you don't actually   need we're not playing a g chord like this 
with this finger down with this finger down   i'm just only playing holding down at least 
this third fret on the sixth string and then   with any sixth string rooted chord you're skipping 
the a string and you're going to play the rest of   the notes above the root on the fourth third and 
second string so we're playing the root down here   on the sixth string and then you're playing 
string three thumb jumps up to string four   second and then second string with your m finger 
with your middle finger okay this is the pattern   the inside outside pattern now if you're going to 
play a fifth string rooted chord let's go to a c   chord here then the pattern is just 
contained in all four metal strings   so this is the inside outside pattern on c or 
any chord that's rooted off the fifth string   by default these things can make 
alterations on them which we'll talk about   another time but that's the fifth string rooted 
chords if it's a fourth string rooted chord then   you're just playing top four strings only so this 
is a d chord and you're playing the same pattern and then you got thumb inside thumb outside 
thumb inside thumb outside okay so with all of   these patterns the string groupings are the same 
sixth string rooted chord you're playing strings   five and then four three two fifth string rooted 
chord you're playing the middle fourth strings   fourth string rooted chord you're playing the 
top of four strings again as default you can   venture away from that later and add more 
complexity to the patterns but this is the   foundational version of these fingerpicking 
patterns so here's a very common chord progression   that i'm going to play each pattern through this 
is the chord progression of one of my favorite   country songs of all time by buck owens called 
love's gonna live here i'm gonna play half of it   at half time speed so you can see the pattern 
really slowly and hear it functionally working   nice and slow through a chord progression then 
i'm gonna double speed for the second half so   you can hear how it sounds when it's sped up 
so here's the demonstration one two three four so now i'm going to sing the first verse 
of this song love's going to live here   just so you can hear how this super simple 
inside outside pattern which at first might   seem so basic how we're going to use it in 
real music well it really works quite quite   well over real music it also is the foundation 
to get more complex finger picking patterns down   but it's great on its own too i'm going to speed 
it up quite a bit just so you can hear how it   might sound if you work towards getting this 
faster and using it as your own accompaniment oh   the sun's gonna shine in my life once 
more love's gonna live here again things are gonna be the way they were 
before love's gonna live here again time for pattern two we're not gonna 
need to spend much time here because   it is just the flip it's called the outside 
inside and you already know what it's to be we're   keeping the base the same all the time and you're 
going to play thumb outside thumb inside thumb   outside thumb inside the groupings of the 
notes along with the chords stay the same   everything's the same you're just flipping 
outside and inside so so here's that same   progression nice and slow and then doubling 
the speed halfway through one two three four now let's listen to it in the context 
of our song in real music i'm gonna   play it nice and fast again and this 
is the chorus of love's gonna live here   the progression is the same throughout 
the whole song this is the chorus   love's gonna live here love's gonna 
live here love's gonna live here again no more loneliness only okay the next pattern is when it gets fancy 
this is called the pinch pattern and it is   the most common finger picking pattern of all 
time and the most useful if there's one you're   ever going to learn it should be this one it is 
just fantastic sounds good slow sounds good fast   it is just a wonderful pattern and the 
first two are a great foundation to then   creating this pattern especially the outside 
inside because the pinch pattern is simply   two outside inside patterns in a row except 
the first one we're going to do this motion   that is called the pinch motion because you're 
playing thumb you're plucking with thumb   and the m finger the middle finger 
at the same time towards each other   in this pinching motion so that's called the 
pinch so we're pinching and because we played   those two together we're letting it sustain or 
you can think of it as kind of resting for a note   instead of going base outside base inside 
you're going together weight base inside instead of okay so you got a little a 
little syncopation there which is what   makes this is gonna sound like it kind 
of bounces and has more texture to it so   okay and the second time you're just playing 
a normal outside inside so you got pinch thumb   inside okay so pinch weight thumb inside thumb 
outside thumb inside that is the pattern pinch   weight thumb inside thumb outside thumb inside 
except and that's totally the pinch pattern i   like to take away the very last eighth note 
the very last inside as well so it gets even   a little more of a bounce to it okay so i like 
to take that last note away which will be this the reason taking that last knot away is 
nice is that if you want to work towards   playing really fast finger picking it gives you 
a little space the syncopation sounds great too   but it gives you just a little space to switch 
chords and to just have it feel more relaxed   with the right hand so i typically play it that 
way if we filled it in it would sound like this just a little crammed to throw that in and 
get back to the pinch so i like to leave that   out so that's the pinch pattern the 
grouping of the strings is the same   here it sounds here's what it sounds like on c   i'm swinging it a little bit too you can play it 
nice and straight or swing nice and straight or swinging a little either way here it is on d 
okay now here it is through our progression   it's nice and slow and then speeding it up 
double speed halfway through one two three four all right let's plug it into our song we're gonna 
do the second verse of love's gonna live here   same tempo same progression just so we can hear 
that context of the pinch pattern as accompaniment   in a real song i hear bells are ringing i hear 
birds are singing love's gonna live here again you hear how the pinch pattern has that bounce 
to it it's just so effective as an accompaniment   pattern it's just fantastic finger picking pattern 
to play with that's the one i used in the intro   of this video as well okay the fourth pattern 
in our top four finger picking guitar patterns   is called the descending arpeggio because it does 
exactly that it arpeggiates the chord from the top   downward we're going to do a pinch and then 
play the middle note and then the thumb does   its thing it's never going to change the thumb is 
always doing it so now the top note of the thumb   baseline is part of this arpeggio descending 
arpeggio structure okay so i'll just let you   look at it on the screen while i play it really 
really slowly so you can mimic that if you need to   the descending arpeggio part is so the thumb the bass is kind of taking part of   this melodic sound if you want to listen 
to it that way okay that's what it is on g you can just apply that to the middle 
four strings or the top four strings   okay here it is through our progression 
super slowly than speeding up halfway   through like we've been doing one two three four as for plugging it into the song well this song 
is so beautiful and so simple it just has those   two verses and then it has the chorus so we could 
sing the chorus again for this but you heard the   chorus before let's do a guitar solo over this 
descending arpeggio pattern so we can hear it in   context of music so i'll play through the 
progression exactly the same way with the   descending arpeggio pattern and then play a guitar 
solo on top of it for our song one two one two if you want some really beautiful really amazing 
cords to practice your finger picking guitar   patterns with then definitely download my chord 
chart called chords with color it's unlike any   other chord chart out there it shows a bunch 
of chords through several keys and then tons   of alternative options for each of those chords so 
you can add color to them and extensions and just   beautiful alterations that still work equally 
well in whatever setting your chord was in   a song you're working on or performing and it's 
just wonderful for listening to sounds practicing   technique studying the chord theory of something 
and working on finger picking guitar patterns   so check that out free download you can go to 
chordswithcolor.com or just click the link in   the top of the description so which fingerpicking 
guitar pattern out of the four was your favorite   and which one are you going to commit to learning 
so you can use it in any and every song that you   work on next was it the inside outside pattern 
the outside inside pattern the pinch pattern or   the descending arpeggio pattern let me know in the 
comments i would love to hear from you i post new   lessons every week next week i am going to share a 
solo guitar arrangement of autumn leaves beautiful   simple easy arrangement and share 
the sheet music for that as well so   hope to see you in that lesson take care 
thanks for watching and happy practicing
