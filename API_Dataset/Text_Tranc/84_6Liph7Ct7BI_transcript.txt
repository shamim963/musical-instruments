[Music] today we're going to learn how to play the new version of spin you around by Morgan Wallen you can play this in drop d tuning if you want but I'm going to do it standard tuning with the Capo on the second fret and the recording is done with two guitars but I'm going to show you how I would play it with just one guitar by myself let's get it learned the chord positions we'll play here are G we'll play D A I'm going to play it in this position but I'm also just going to play it with a bar of my first finger here on the second fret because I'm going to be adding the third fret at times on the second string so we'll play that a both ways we'll also play the B minor chord [Music] our intro goes from B minor to G then D to a so real quick if you just want to strum the song You Can Do down down up down down up for the strumming down down up down down up down down up down down up you can use that strumming pattern throughout the whole song Let's Learn this picking for the [Music] intro so we start on our B minor position and here we're going to pick the fifth string then the fourth string then the third and the second strings together I pick those with my second and third fingers and then we're going to pick the third and second strings again but this time open so here's what that looks [Music] like then we go to the G position and we're going to go sixth string then fourth string and I'm going to take my first finger put it here on the third string second fret because we're going to pick the third and the second strings together and we're going to hammer on so pick three and two together and then we're going to hammer on the third string from the second up to the fourth fret and then we're going to come back off and pick the third and the second strings again then we'll go to our D chord and just go 4 3 2 3 then we'll go to our a position and go 5 4 3 then we're going to come to the fourth string open that up pick that then we're going to hammer up to the second fret then up to the fourth fret and then we're going to open the fourth string so we're hammering all that and then pulling back off Hammer Hammer then pull off to leave the fourth string open to end that then we're going to repeat that same picking so here's what that looks like straight through the [Music] intro that ends our intro then here we're going to go up to the G chord to start the verse now the picking we're going to do for the verse for the G chord will just go 6 4 2 3 4 simple picking for the D we'll go 4 3 2 3 4 and for the a we'll go 5 4 2 3 4 and if you just want to use your first finger as a bar you can add the third fret here so that's the picking we need for the verse here's how we play through the first verse I've been looking at you from across the [Music] room about time I got Miner well you might tell me boy hell no but hell can reverse ends there on the a then we're going to go up to the B minor to start the chorus and the picking for the B minor is going to be the same as our a chord so it's 5 4 2 3 4 here's how we play through the chorus cuz I just want to spin you round and round this dance floor get you drunk on a love like mine
