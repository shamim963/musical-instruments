[Music] thank you [Music] I made up that last part it's not part of the song we made it looking out for you by Joy again great news it's all Barre chords the entire song is bar chords look [Music] play the bar chords pointer finger fifth fret it's in standard tuning pointer finger fifth fret on the top string ring finger seventh fret on the second string from the top pinky seventh fret on the third string from the top middle finger sixth fret on the third string from the bottom so starting from the top five seven seven six and then the part that you all hate your pointer finger smashes down not just on the fifth fret of the top string but on all six strings of the guitar let's talk about this bar chord very briefly I said you have to push on all six strings but I was actually completely lying to you for almost all Barre chords you don't have to push on all six strings you only need to push on the strings that you need to that you need to push on okay so okay so let's see okay so look for this chord you need to push on the top string that's crucial second string for the top your ring finger has that one covered third string from the top your pinky has that one covered fourth string from the top your middle finger has that one covered so it only your pointer finger does need to push on the bottom too so it needs the top and the bottom two okay great so that means your finger is going to end up touching all the strings but look at this look at this the tip of my finger is getting the top string then I'm not really worrying about trying to push with this part of my finger my finger has this little teeny curve to it a little curve to it and the base of my finger down here is really leaning into those bottom two strings so my hand is kind of pulling the base of my finger against the bottom the tip of my finger is pushing on top but look look I would like to show you something at this point in time observe my a major bar chord it sounds beautiful it's one of the greatest I've ever heard in my entire life but if I get rid of these three fingers look at this here's now I just have the bar chord listen listen listen did you hear of the the second from the top third from the top and fourth from the top were muted I've got this little again that little curve with my finger do you do you understand what I'm saying you don't need to push on all of them just stop and just have their little just like that and it's just you're gonna do great I I think you're gonna do great I have full confidence in you a major bar chord let's learn the strumming pattern just on this one chord I feel like the lights are so bright in my bed in my eyes on this a major bar chord you're going to start by strumming down those times in a row that's Spanish for two I'm surprised you didn't know that [Music] do it with me one two three oh we did it stormed down twice easy easy immediately after that second strum Down You're Gonna strum down up so now we've got this down down up let's do that uh let's do that together like as a partnership one two three four down down down up one two three four down down down up great you did it amazing at this point we must switch to the next chord which is an F sharp minor bar chord pointer finger second fret on the top string ring finger fourth fret on the second string from the top pinky fourth fret on the third string from the top and yes your pointer finger needs to smash down on every single Fring single string strangle thing well I think this video is a lost cause at this point should I pause should I stop it oh my goodness that's out of focus my nose looks huge um you've got your pointer finger there on the second fret but here's what I would also like you to do I would like you to take your middle finger because we're not using a middle finger for a different note for this chord so you're gonna take your middle finger and Smash down on your pointer finger to help your pointer finger smash down onto every single string on the second fret there if it was Justin for my pointer finger can I do it oh I can do it but just barely but if my middle finger helps oh that's great now another little Barre chord trick here you might find that you can't get your your fingers just don't want to stretch out far enough you're like my fingers don't spread out I can't do it my hands are too small fingers are too short I give up assume how my thumb is poking up over the top it's bad news it's bad news you want to bring your thumb back down here look look look look I'm gonna get up to do it for you the pointer melt the thing what is this called your thumb is on the back it's not up over the top it's down here so down here when you're playing bar Chords it's like you want to have it so that you're it feels like you're pushing your pointer finger and your thumb together you see that if it's up here you can't do it your fingers get all scrunched together F sharp minor bar chord the hardest of the bar chords if you ask me F minor is harder but F sharp minor is pretty tough we just did on the a down down down up and then I told you we need to go to that F sharp minor however before we go to the F sharp minor we actually are going to strum down just on like the muted strings as you are switching chords so check this out a major chord we go down down down up then immediately we come back down but I'm already starting to switch chords as I'm switching it I just hit whatever whatever sound the strings make they just make that sound if they're open great if they're muted great if I've already made it to the F sharp minor great but watch watch this in super slow motion it sounds like this down down up down up and then I came up on the F sharp minor let me do that for you one more time soup burst slow motion one two three four down down down up switch up that time I just hit the muted strings did you hear that I'm very passionate about switching strings chords not feeling it at all today it's a Sunday Who records a video on Sunday kind of monster records a video on Sunday let's do the a go into the F sharp minor together very slowly one two here we go and down down switch up and one more time here we go and [Music] and switch up but Stuart I hate these bar chords still what do I do well you could play power chords do you know what power chords are that's where you're not actually barring you're just playing like those top three notes they're just like fifth fret seventh fret seventh fret and then you just mute the rest of the strings it's just that little Punchy little chords you can do that you go [Music] tune you hear that nonsense I went like this for some reason well you know I got all tuned back up and now we're ready to go our minor we started off by coming on the F sharp minor but after you strum up you're gonna strum up down up after that so it's up up down up just just say the words out loud up up down up great job saying those words now play go up up down up you must go up up down up you may not go up down up down that would be a disaster up up down up and then after that you're going to play up down up one more time so this whole thing on the F sharp minor is up up down up up down let's do that all together one two here we go up up down up up down up one two here we go up up down up up down up so now when we put these two guitar chords together it sounds like this down down down up down up up down up up down up let's do it slower that was too fast that was too fast so I apologize for the speed of my playing one two three that was the exact same speed wasn't it one two three four down down down up switch up up down up up down up one two one more time down pop switch up up down up up down up have you noticed that when I am not in the mood to do this I just get louder I just yell more things I just yell more things the whole time well let's learn the next couple chords what do you say what do you say gang after the F sharp minor we're going to a C sharp minor pointer finger plays the fourth fret on the second string from the top now here's where things start getting really gnarly so pointer fingers on the fourth fret of the second string from the top we are going to bar with that finger which means we're going to push down on the rest of the strings I say the red I'm just vague on purpose okay look shut up and let me explain the chord pointer fingers on the fourth fret of the second string from the top pushing down on the remaining bottom five strings however the tip of your pointer finger needs to touch the top string can you see what's happening look it's look at this view look look look look look look look do you see out my pointer finger you see that look at that thing oh my gosh it's touching it so I'm not pushing on it just touching it just touching it guys muting it we don't want to hear that note ring finger sixth fret on the third string from the top pinky sixth fret on the third string from the bottom middle finger fifth fret on the second string from the bottom pointer finger is barring the bottom string along with playing that fourth string from the top and muting the top string C sharp minor chord on this very chord we're going to play the exact same strumming we did on the a chord we're going to be playing down down down up watch me play all of these chords down down up switch up up down up up down up C sharp down up at this point in time on this very C sharp minor chord we are going to start off by strumming down down down up the exact same thing we played on the first chord the a chord but then we're gonna add some more strums to it look at this down down down up one two play with me down watch down down down up down up one two here we go down down down up down down after that last up we just did on the C sharp minor tiny tiny itsy bitsy little pause then you're gonna strum up again and then you're going to strum down but with our muted strumming just like we did before as we're switching chords so it's up and then we come down on the muted strings and then up on this C minor Barre chord the way that you get the C minor bar chords you take the C sharp minor chord that we just had and you just move everything over one fret pointer finger still touching the top string your pointer fingers playing the third fret on the second string from the top fifth fret on the third from the top fifth fret on the third string from the bottom and then middle finger is playing the fourth fret on the second string from the bottom pointer finger is touching or okay look let me tell you one more thing about bar chords okay let's say that you've got first few notes oh they're so good so good but the last note oh poop it's muted your pointer fingers not pushing hard enough on that bottom when I can't my middle finger is getting in the way my pinky is getting the way everything is falling apart my life is over um just let that string be muted nobody cares you could barely even hear it look here it is with all the strings here it is with the bottom string muted they both sound great give me a break foreign s with one muted string still sound pretty good and I'm pretending of sick that they're not I'm pretending I'm sick that they're not that's what I tried to say the whole time I didn't misspeak that's what I meant to say [Music] I've lost I don't know what we're done what are we doing C minor on that chord you're gonna stream up that's what I was trying to say look look on the C sharp minor we're going down down down up down up up mute up and then on this same C minor chord we're gonna strum up down up again it may all makes it all makes perfect sense look down down down up down up what am I doing down down down up down up up loot up up down up [Music] I don't know I think that strumming was okay look when we get to the C sharp I'm just gonna go over it again instead of going back and doing a better job I'm just gonna do it again on the C sharp minor we go down down down up down up up and then muted and then up on the C minor where you just move everything over and on this we go up up down up down down down up down up up down up up down up one two super slow down down down up down up up mute up up down up uh I don't think that was any better I think that was pretty much exactly the same after the C sharp minor we moved to a B minor chord we take the exact same shape and move it over one more fret so now it's pointer fingers on the second fret of the second string from the top ring fingers on four of the third from the top Pinky's on four of the third from the bottom middle finger is on three of the second from the bottom and then pointer finger is smashing down on the bottom string E minor that was C sharp minor C minor and C sharp minor all the exact same shape hand is in the same position just moving it to different places on the neck this whole sequence we just did was C sharp minor down down down up down up up new up up down up B minor coming down on that big old B minor at this point in time we're almost done with the introduction to the song that's what we've been learning is introduction after the introduction is the verse which is exactly the same as the introduction which means we are essentially done with like two-thirds of the song okay let's finish up this part on the B minor chord what I'm not look this whole next part of the song we do the exact same strumming that we did for that first part of the song and you're like dude I couldn't even follow any of the strumming you were talking about that's fine I'll I'll re-explain it but let me just tell you this the strumming for the next the next little part you just copy the strumming you already did exactly that means the Rhythm with the ups and downs and all that anyway B minor chord we just got to the B minor chord you already know it you already know the B minor because I just explained it you are going to strum this down down down up down up up down up up down up down down down up down up up down up up down up that is the same strumming we did for the A and the F sharp look [Music] remember that down down down up down up up down up up down up now we're doing that same strumming on the B minor down down up down up up down up up down up we just don't have to switch chords in the middle after we do that strumming on the B minor we move back to the C sharp minor do you remember that chord it's the one that we did it was like the the third chord we did it was pointer finger on the fourth fret of the second string from the top ring finger on six of the next string pinky on six of the next one middle finger on five of the second string for the bottom pointer fingers touching the top string and playing the bottom one C sharp minor chord you're gonna do the exact same starting on this one down down down up down up up down up up down up down down down up down up up and down up down up this whole these these new two chords we just look D minor foreign [Music] let's play it let's play the whole thing starting from the a nice and slow one two three four down down up and up up down up up down up C sharp down up down up up and up up down up down down back and then you start over [Music] I'm Out Of Tune again also I played that twice are you proud of me for the introduction of the song you play those exact chords with that exact strumming twice then you get into the verse of the song where the singing starts and you play those exact same chords with the exact same strumming twice then we go to the pre-chorus of the song or the second part of the verse and you do those exact same chords with the exact same strumming twice then we get to the chorus and that part's different but before we get to the chorus I would like to show you this fun little lead part that goes on in the background of the pre-chorus are you ready to begin first thing you're going to do is play the fifth fret on the bottom string then you're gonna play the fourth fret on the bottom string then you're gonna play the bottom string open ah it's gonna be slow I guess it goes one two three four five four zero easy after that you play the second fret on the second string from the bottom then you play the third fret on the second string from the bottom so on the bottom that was five four zero then two on the second string from the bottom three on the second string from the bottom then second string from the bottom open don't push on it and then second fret on the second string from the bottom again and then finally bottom string open so that was five four zero two on the second three on the second zero on the second two on the second zero on the bottom right [Music] it's just a nice little lead part that look I just thought some of you might want to play that okay give me a break it's just a part of the song that's what this whole thing is it's uh me telling you how to play the song and that's part of it time to learn the chorus we're almost done the chorus and then the final chord and then we're done chorus goes like this it does that three times and it goes look it's not a bar chord finally a chord that's not a barre chord in this song D major bar chord this is the this is the if you thought the other bar chords were worse if you're bad this one is so much worse so much worse pointer finger fifth fret on the second string from the top just like before we're gonna try to mute the top string so the tippiest tip of my fingers meeting the top string pushing on the fifth fret of the second string from the top and we all know what's gonna happen I'm gonna take that finger and lay it down on all the other strings two ring finger plays the seventh fret on the third string from the top but this is where it gets really stupid my ring finger is going to sking to smash down on the next two strings is shut up computer I'm trying to what are you doing I'm trying to do something do you see how stupid my ring finger is like this knuckle right here is all flattened out and this part's jetting out over there so what I've got is muted top string pointer finger on the fifth fret of the second string from the top a ring finger I'm playing the seventh fret on the third string from the top seventh fret on the fourth string from the top and seventh fret on the fifth string from the top but to make things even worse so your ring finger already has to do that stupid thing but you also so want to make sure your ring finger is not pushing on the seventh fret of the bottom string we don't want that note well we want the bottom string to sound like is either the fifth fret that your pointer finger is pushing on or just a muted string if your ring finger is muting the bottom string honestly that's fine when I play this chord usually I just have the bottom string muted what that means what that means is for this bar chord you don't actually have to play it as your as a bar chord your pointer finger doesn't have to push down on all the strings it just needs to touch most of them and needs to push on the fifth fret of the top string and just can't say anything right it needs to push on the fifth fret of the second string from the top and just touch all the other ones Discord sucks okay now if you want you could do it like this or see I'm using three separate fingers instead of the one finger I played it like this for like a decade and I I never was happy with how it sounded I never was happy with how it felt it was annoying I don't love doing it this way but I think it's way better so I really recommend you try to do it this way where your ring finger pushes down on all three of those but if you're just like I just hate my life and I don't want to do it you can do it this way [Music] D It's called The D on this chord we're gonna strum down down down up down okay and then you're gonna switch to the C sharp minor we've already done it many times and you're gonna go uh up up down up up down up so up up down up up down up I'm so mad at this D chord so we got down down down up down up up down it's the same strumming we did in the other parts of the song down down down up down up up down up up down up um remember when we went like it's the same strumming then you go to a B minor we've already done a B minor two remember the one on the second fret second fret fourth fret fourth fret third fret and you do the same strumming down down up down up up down up I've lost all passion for teaching this song but we just we're just gonna finish it we do that little chord progression three times the D to the C sharp minor to the B minor now I know what you're thinking you're thinking Stuart if this is a d chord why don't I just play it like this why don't I just do the regular D they sound literally exactly the same now okay you could you could do that but then you're just gonna have to quickly switch to this totally Other Bar chord it's gonna be so much easier look how look how close those are versus how far away those are and this one's not gonna sound right with all the strumming we just we want to do it this way let's just [Music] what we do this three times then we start it a fourth time but then instead of going to B minor the fourth time we go to a classic e the ultimate Cowboy core top string open middle finger second fret on the second string from the top ring finger second fret on the third string from the top pointer finger first fret on the third string From The Bottom the remaining two strings are open and we're gonna strum down down down up down up up down up up down up [Music] up up down up up down up down I played the same thing again what's happening here's the complete chorus all the way through one two three four down down switch slower so you can play it along how about that one two play with me down do it again one more time now this last time we're gonna start the same then go to E and then look what happens after that [Music] that's right we're back to the main section of the song one more time together we play the intro then you play the verse then you play the pre-chorus which all of those are exactly the same then we play the chorus the part we just did great then we go through that whole entire cycle again you play the intro again this time though it's not an intro anymore it's like an interlude then you play the verse then you play the pre-chorus then you play the chorus again um and then I don't know maybe something else happens I do not recall it just it does those same chords again it's the same chords for most of the song with the same strumming and then when you end it I believe that in the studio recording that has the banjo and stuff I believe they just end with the a bar chord the first chord we played but when you listen to it to them play it live they end with this a six chord I played it very aggressively just there check out this A6 chord it's great you're gonna love it you play pointer finger is going to play the fifth fret on the top string uh then I'm gonna actually I'm gonna do it oh this I played it I played it wrong I played it wrong when I did it before just pay attention don't pay attention right a second ago pay attention to what I'm doing now pointer finger fifth fret on the top string ring finger is going to play seventh fret on the second string from the top middle finger is going to skip the D string the third string from the top and go to the sixth fret on the third string from the bottom and then your pinky plays seven on the second string from the bottom now here's something important do not bar with your pointer finger with your pointer finger play the top string but just touch the other strings then you get this beautiful A6 chord it's five seven muted six seven muted or with your pointer finger you can try to get the bottom string on five that it's an A6 chord guys I would just like to say that I enjoyed every second of this guitar tutorial video with you I never lost my temper and I love all the bar chords just like I know you will [Music]
