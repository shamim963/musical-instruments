name is Dave and welcome to another guitars R Hero song tutorial in this lesson I'm going to teach you how to play the acoustic version of Linger by The Cranberries for the basics of this song you just need a guitar and St in your tuning and you won't need a capo if you want to master your cords back to front then be sure to head over to guitars hero.com to pick up my free guitar ebook finally this lesson simply teaches you one song but if really understanding and learning the guitar something you've always wanted to do but you didn't know where to start then be sure to check out the guitar Z hero premium course and membership which gives you all the guidance to play with confidence I'll leave a link to it in the description let's jump into the lesson let's start with the optional intro riff which is super simple to play we're going to start by Fring a d chord so index and middle finger on the second Frets of the third and first string and ring finger on the third fret of the second string we'll just pluck the third second and first strings with a down down up and that's at eighth notes 1 and two and and we play that on the three and four beat 1 and two and three and four and the second bar is just the same so we repeat that again and for the third bar we just lift our index finger from this D shape and we're going to pluck the exact same strings and we repeat that picking pattern through four times one and 2 and 3 and four and 1 and 2 and 3 and four and so the optional intro just sounds like [Music] this that riff is just repeated through a number of times before the actual song starts just before the song starts we play this position with just three picking patterns we hold that out for the rest of the bar and for another bar and we jump into the chords so now we get into the main part of the song and it's a four chord chord progression throughout the entire thing again it just goes to show you what four chords can do you can build an amazing song around four chords so for our four chord chord progression we stay on the D now we just want to strum from the fourth string onwards with a d now if you happen to hit the fifth string that's okay but we definitely don't want the sixth string bringing out so I mute that by lightly touching it with my thumb over the top of the neck like that and that way if you strummed all the strings that E string is not going to ring out then we go to a a chord so you can play this in a few different ways with your index middle and ring finger your middle ring and pinky finger or you can just use your index finger to bar across the second Frets of the fourth third and second strings we are just strumming from the fifth string onwards with our a chord so again don't want that sixth string ringing at then we have a c chord and finally a G chord now our string pattern throughout the entire song is going to go something like this down down up down down up up down down up down up and in succession down down up down down up up down down up down [Music] up so play that a few times without any chords just to get the Rhythm into your strumming hand once you have the strumming pattern down we can now apply it to the chords we're going to play that strumming pattern twice for each chord so each chord is played for two bars and that will sound like this 1 2 3 4 [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that can be and that can be played throughout the entire song but we're going to add one extra thing and this makes it more true to the studio recording in how they play this acoustically so we're going to add some variations to the D chord and the C chord the A and the g remain as is so with the decord on the highlighted strums that you see here so the two up strums we're going to temporarily lift our middle finger to play D sus 2 on these two strums so down down down up down down up up down down up down up so notice it's just very temporary we lift our middle finger the strumming pattern stays identical though we're just changing our friending [Music] hand and that's played through twice for the D as I said the a Remains the Same with the c chord we're going to do something very similar on the exact same strums as well we're going to lift our index finger this time to play a C major 7 so that will sound like [Music] this and the g Remains the Same so with those variations in mind this is what the main core progression sounds like one two three [Music] and that is everything for this beautiful song So now I'll be doing a full playthrough of the song and I'll have a vocal track on top for some context feel free to play this back as many times as You' like to to practice play along to and see how you go [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you good don't let it burn Don't Let It Fade
