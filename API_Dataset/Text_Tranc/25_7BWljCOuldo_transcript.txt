[Music] foreign [Music] 505. I really struggled not to call it back to 505 because well because he says back to 505 so that must be the title of the song it's by Arctic Monkeys my name is Stuart welcome to the channel guys okay what we gotta do today is we gotta have a guitar that is in standard tuning the other thing you need to do is you need to learn these chords and notes I'm going to show you first things first I need to tell you that this song does not need to have any bar chords in it has optional bar chords I'll show you I'm going to take you through the different riffs they all just repeat a bunch but here's the basic the basic thing you need to know is these two chords right here this is a D minor and an E minor guys put your pointer finger on the fifth fret of the bottom string put your middle finger on the sixth fret of the second to bottom string put your ring finger on the seventh fret of the third string from the bottom go ahead and just strum those bottom three strings did you see the spit that left my mouth play the bottom three strings just nice and gentle I do this like nice like slow strum I'm not like picking each note but I'm just slowly going through so I hear the Cascade of notes from the chord D Minor guys you play that you go one two three four then you just take the exact same shape and move it one two Frets up so now you're on seven eight and nine and just strum that two three four if you just strummed those two chords for the entire song that would work you could play that and sing along it would be a great time but do we want it to be a little more interesting right so here's what I recommend at the beginning the organ is playing we are I we don't I we're gonna play the organ part on guitar which is just what we just did those two chords you do that probably like four times or something right just back and forth between those two chords then you hear the guitar enter and it's doing exactly what we're doing so we're still just doing this now if you would like so this these chords are pretty much what they're doing on the recording but if you want a little bit more depth to these chords here's what you can do take your ring finger move it one string up so now your ring fingers on the seventh fret of the third string from the top then put your pinky on the seventh fret of the third string from the bottom so we were doing this with three fingers now you move your ring finger up add your pinky right there strum the bottom four strings still not a bar chord as you can see but the chords and then just take that shape and move it up sound a little bit Fuller here's what I like to do I like to do the three note version like four times and then after I've done that four times I go ahead and switch and then it kind of builds up we can feel the we can feel the the the the excitement of the song building as time goes on okay let me show you this fancy little thing here when they get to the chorus they add in this thing so here's how we do that you play the first chord two three then you play the second one two you play that second chord you just hold it out for two beats just one two then you abandon that chord and on the bottom string play 12 10 8 7. that was 12. ten eight seven because it's all in one string and it's not too fast you could probably use one finger to play all of that and go I like to go like this I go ring finger pointer finger and then middle finger pointer finger it just makes it easier for me it doesn't change the sound of it at all let's practice doing the chords and that little lead part how about twice in a row one two three four and chord two then move it up and one two twelve ten eight seven chord that's a little tricky getting back to the chord and one two twelve ten eight seven yes I believe they do that four times in a row for the chorus I got a message it is a boring message and that's what I have to say about that okay guys we have to learn the solo after the first chorus I assume it's the chorus when he sings Back to 505 back to 505 that's the chorus right we have to go like this we have to go [Music] so here's what this is third string from the bottom you're gonna play nine seven five four two nine seven five four two here's the Rhythm nine seven five four two fast fast slow slow slow one more time bing bang bang great then go right back up to four and then right back up to five so now it's nine seven five four two four five let's play it one more time nine seven five four two four five and then you're gonna play five five five five five four the way I'm doing that over here I'm going down up down up down if I try to go down down down down down it sounds too frantic and you guys know me I don't like to I don't like to sound frantic at all so everyone five five five five four no that was the opposite of what I wanted five five five five four what am I doing up down up down up I don't know alternate your pick direction is what I'm trying to say I'm definitely dying nine seven five four two four five five five five five four yeah I go up down up down up that's the opposite what I said earlier great okay I'm so glad this is going so well my name is Stuart welcome to the channel go ahead and like And subscribe and all that stuff I have the microphone in the worst place where it gets a shadow on my face see look oh my face is lit my face is dark you can't tell hi did I already say subscribe go ahead and you know whatever okay can you play that then you're on to now you're on the fourth fret you go up down up down slide up to nine and go up down up down up down up when you put it it sounds confusing it just goes like this [Music] just copy that Rhythm it doesn't even need to be perfect guys let's play that all the way through together twice that's the solo one two three four [Music] then we just go right back to the chords guys okay now at this point it gets a little quiet part where it's very quiet and then it gets very loud it gets very loud you have two options you have we have multiple options in your loud part here's what's probably going to be your best bet but it does involve bar chords but you don't have to do it check it out we need a D Minor bar chord have your pointer finger bar everything on the fifth fret so you're just smashing down on the fifth fret of all six strings put your middle finger on the sixth fret of the second string from the bottom then have your ring finger on the seventh fret of the third string from the top and your pinky on the seventh fret of the third string from the bottom here's the Rhythm we're gonna do we're gonna go down up up down up up down up up down up let's do that together so it was down up up down up up down up up down up oh one two three four down up up down up up down up up down up have you noticed I I I'm not even joking at all I completely have been thinking about something completely unrelated but like I was deep in thought about it and just in total autopilot could you see in my eyes could you see all life leave my eyes and I'm just did I did the things I just say made sense because I was really truly in a whole different world okay we do that on this D minor chord then you just take that same I'm back by the way I'm here you take that same bar chord and you move it one two Frets over this is an E minor bar chords now pointer fingers barring on the seventh fret ring fingers on nine pinkies on nine middle fingers on eight and you do the same rhythm it's pretty fun right you get to rock back and forth like that oh my computer's dying so my frame rate's getting very weak I better hurry up and get through this thing so you do that the other option you can do that's kind of fun is you can go [Music] so what I'm doing here is this with my pointer finger I am borrowing again but it's easy you just play the bottom three strings all on the 10th fret and we pluck up up on those bottom three strings actually it's up up down up up down up up down up up down so check this out we're going just those three notes then you slide that up to the 12th fret and do the exact same thing [Music] foreign then we get to the outro solo where we go [Music] here's it's almost exactly the same as what we're doing over here [Music] but it's higher up on the guitar we go like this we go 12 10 8 7 5 12 10 875 it's like a phone number but except for phone numbers don't have the number 12 in them one two three four twelve ten eight seven five then back to seven then back to eight eight seven then you go seven seven seven twelve twelve twelve twelve twelve twelve twelve [Music] [Applause] they do that four times in a row guys how about you and I do it two times in a row one two nice and slow [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] foreign look at this we just oh I messed it up I was on a roll and then I messed it up what I was gonna say is you just go back to the solo from the middle of the song you do that like four times and then the song's over and it ends on a big old cord is it on an E minor Zen on a D Minor let's see I made up a whole new part of the song I say we end on it on a D minor chord guys that was the five six seven just go and then it's the end of the song so I don't feel like I I don't feel like I really taught you this song [Music] foreign
