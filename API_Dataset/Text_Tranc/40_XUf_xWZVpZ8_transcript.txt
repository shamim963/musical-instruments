hi kids my name is kelly and this is a series of lessons for beginner guitar for this lesson you're gonna need a guitar and a guitar pick if you don't have a guitar pick that's okay too you can just use your thumb to play the strings like this in this lesson we're going to be talking about the parts of the guitar the guitar anatomy how to hold the guitar how to pick the strings [Music] and how to strum the strings there are two different kinds of guitars that you can use there are acoustic guitars and there are electric guitars for this lesson i'm going to be using my acoustic guitar because it's a little bit simpler but if you have an electric guitar that's fine too you're going to want to plug into your amp with a cable as well let's start with the parts of the guitar this is the picture of the guitar with the main parts labeled this is the body the neck is here the strings are going up and down there are six strings the head is here these are called the tuners they help us to tune the guitar and these frets are these metal parts here that go across the neck of the guitar and then there's the bridge here so holding the guitar is very important because you want to be able to have the guitar sitting uh in a way that's comfortable for you so you're gonna take the guitar and set it on your right thigh so that this little bump out right here is sitting right on the top of your thigh and then what i do is i have my arm come over the top like this and hold it in place like this so you want to be able to hold the instrument like this without using your left hand or fretting hand to be holding it up that's really important because when you start moving this hand around if you're also supporting it it's going to be moving around on you when you're trying to do stuff you're going to want the guitar to have like a little bit of an upward angle or straight like this and um not down like this oh if you're a left-handed player just follow the instructions but the exact opposite so your guitar will sit on your left thigh your left arm will come over the top and your right hand will be the one that's fretting the notes let's talk about picking the strings so if you have your pick you're going to hold it between your pointer finger and your thumb like this okay and the pointy part of the pick is going to point at your guitar so if you look at your pick it almost has like a teardrop shape triangle shape with the pointy part that pointy part points at the guitar and let's pick our strings like this [Music] six five four three two one if you do not have a pick you can use your thumb six five four three two one six five four three two one the reason why i'm counting back from six to one is because that's how the strings are numbered on the guitar the first string is actually on the bottom down here so if you were to count from one to six you would count from the bottom one two three four five six one two three four five six six five four three two one all right let's try a jam track together one two three four [Music] six five four three two one six five four three two one nice job playing along with that jam track playing along with the beat is always good because it's training you to play with other musicians perhaps your guitar doesn't sound like mine chances are that it's out of tune if you haven't tuned it recently most likely it's out of tune guitars need to be tuned weekly and sometimes every single time you play them i've already made a video for how to tune the guitar and i'll leave a link in the description below but just so you know if you want to tune your guitar what you're going to do is you're going to get a tuner like this this is called a snark tuner and this is what will help you to know whether or not your instrument is in tune [Music] basically what we do is we use these tuners we turn them to make our strings higher or lower and i recommend to not turn these if you do not know how to tune a guitar if you turn them you can make the strings really tight and break them or you can just make your guitar really really out of tune all right that sounds in tune to me now we're gonna talk about strumming the strings so when we pick strings we just do one at a time like this and strumming is the opposite of that it's when we do multiple strings at the same time sometimes we do all the strings sometimes we only do some of the strings [Music] go ahead and strum your strings like this [Music] or if you're using your thumb [Music] you can just kind of drag your thumb down like this across the strings [Music] let's practice this pattern one two three rest one two three rest one two three rest now what we're going to do is just the bottom three strings one two three rest one two three rest one two three rest one two three rest let's try another jam track together one two one two three go [Music] nice so just to review in this lesson we learned about the parts of the guitar how to hold the guitar how to pick strings and how to strum strings in the next video we'll talk about how to fret notes like this [Music] thanks for watching everybody i hope that this video was helpful for your learning please watch the next video in this series because there's so much more to learn [Music]
