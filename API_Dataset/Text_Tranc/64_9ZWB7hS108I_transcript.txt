[Music] Hi! Steve Stine from GuitarZoom.com . And what 
I'd like to do is give you some songs that you   could play with three chords. And not only using 
the same three chords but using them in the same   order just to make things easy. One of the most 
important things I try and teach students is   that along your journey of learning how to play 
guitar and practicing various techniques and all   these sorts of things you should be doing 
two things number one trying to make it as   fun and engaging as possible for you so every 
day when you want to practice again you don't   just go oh no i don't want to do this right and 
the second thing is is just to keep inspired a   lot of times when we play along with songs it 
can be fun for us and it makes us motivated to   want to keep going so what i did here was i chose 
three different songs that i'm going to show you   that use the three chords d c and g in various 
different ways but they're using those same three   chords in the same order over and over and 
over so before i get started with the songs   i want to show you a little bit about chords if 
you don't know these or if you have some questions   and if you already know these three chords you 
can certainly fast forward just a little bit   and get to the songs so first thing i want to 
talk about is some variety of things that we   can do when we're learning how to play chords for 
instance your c might be a little bit different   than my c chord or your g chord might be a little 
bit different and i don't want to worry about that   because we all play things a little 
bit differently like for instance g   if we really thought about it g the g chord across 
the entire guitar can be played all kinds of   different ways um so i don't want to worry about 
whether or not there's seven different ways of   playing a g chord i want you to focus on what 
it is that you're using and if you don't know a   g chord i'm going to give you some suggestions 
okay that sort of thing so let's start with d   and just look at this first chord here okay so 
d chord is played by uh strumming the bottom   four strings and what we're gonna do is put 
our first finger on the third string second   fret we're gonna put our middle finger on the 
first string second fret and we're gonna put   the third finger on the second string third 
fret and we're going to strum the bottom four   now if you strum a few too many don't worry 
about it you're just trying to hit the bottom   four that's really what you're targeting for now c 
is a chord that when it comes up sometimes people   play it differently the standard c generally is 
taught like this okay and this is fine there's   nothing wrong with this c you could put your 
first finger on the second string first fret   you can put your middle finger on the fourth 
string second fret and your third finger   on the fifth string third fret and then 
you would strum the bottom five [Music]   now if you're just learning how to play you might 
play like an easy c where you're just using your   first finger on the second string right there and 
you're just strumming the bottom three strings   and something like that would be just fine and 
then we've got our full c like this that we could   do and again there's lots of different variations 
of c and then we've got our g chord now g you'll   see i'm playing g with four fingers oftentimes 
you'll see people play with three fingers or   they'll just play the first string like 
this so let's talk about that for a second   the way i'm playing g is going to be like this 
i'm going to put my first finger on the fifth   string second fret i'm going to put my middle 
finger on the sixth string third fret i'm going   to put my third finger on the second string third 
fret and my pinky on the first string third fret   okay now what i want to do is throw you a little 
loop though if you've never done this before i   want to show you how to play what's called 
a c add 9 which is a little different than   the normal c chord but we use it a lot 
in popular music you know in blues and   acoustic and you know rock and different 
things like that and basically what you   can do is instead of having to go from this g 
chord right here and flip over to this c chord   what you can do is just keep this g as it 
is and then what you do is you just drop   these two fingers down one string so you're 
going from g like this [Music] to c like this   and then when you want to go to your d chord 
you can leave your third finger where it is and   use that as kind of a a brace to switch over 
to your d chord [Music] okay so we have g c   and d now again if you play those a little 
differently than that don't worry about it   so that's what i'm going to be using now the 
order we're going to be using these chords is   going to be this we're going to go from d to c to 
g that's all the seven songs we're going to talk   about that's all we're doing is moving from d to c 
to g so if you play you know d to easy c to easy g   or something like that that's okay whatever works 
for you so the first song we're gonna look at is   can't you see by marshall tucker okay if you've 
never heard this before it's certainly worth   going and looking up and giving it a listen since 
you're probably on or near youtube anyway right   so we've got d and what we're going to do is 
we're just going to strum that d [Music] c g then back to d now i'm playing d for a measure c for a measure g 
for a measure and then d for a measure so i have   to remember that i've got a d to begin with and 
a d to end with now i'm going to play it again   but this time i'm going to use the c add 9 in 
the middle like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] now either way of playing that c would sound 
just fine regardless of whether you go to a   you know a tablature or chord you know website 
and it says to play it a certain way what i want   you to constantly remind yourself is that it's 
okay to change things a little bit to make it   functional to make it easier to play instead of 
making everything into a a hard you know a chore   now again i'm not saying that you don't want 
to learn to play c this way or c this way   there's all kinds of different things you can 
do depending on where you are in your journey   all i'm saying is try and remember the bottom line 
is here that we want to use songs to have some fun   right to make some sort of musical connection 
to songs that we enjoy to play along with   um you know the music however we like to so 
that's what we're looking for so we've got d c g and back to d okay now we're going to take that same idea we're 
going to use it with a song called sweet child of   mine by guns and roses now the unfortunate part 
is if you try and play along with the actual song   guns and roses tunes down a half step so you'd 
have to tune your guitar down a half step   if you don't know how to do that don't worry 
um maybe you can sing it right you're more   than likely a better singer than i am so what 
you can do is is just play the chords and sing   along now we can only play the verse of this 
song we won't be able to do the chorus because   that's a little different but the verse of 
the song would be this [Music] [Applause] [Music] it starts all over again four measures 
d c g d when it gets to the chorus it goes into a different part all right so we've 
got the verse for that the next two songs that   we've got the rhythm changes just slightly we're 
going to be looking at fall uh fall to pieces by   velvet revolver and we're going to be looking at 
blue on black by kenny wayne shepard and basically   they're kind of the same thing let's look at blue 
on black first so blue on black we're going to go [Music] now there's little things that 
kenny wayne shepard does we're   not worrying about all that we just want 
to play the song okay so we're going d   to c and g but what i want you to notice 
is that the the uh the c and the g chords   we're on those for much less time so 
we're going d then we go to c then g d c g and you can see how we're running into that 
g right away which is a nice time to play this c   add 9 moving to that g because it's really fast to 
just move those two fingers again if you'd rather   play the full c to the full g that's okay but you 
can see why it would be efficient to do it that   way okay fall to pieces is really the same thing 
unfortunately again slash being involved it's a   half step down again so if you try and play along 
with fall to pieces you're gonna have to tune your   guitar down a half step or just sing it yourself 
and uh and don't okay so we have d [Music]   same thing same chord progression same 
kind of movement okay and then the last   three songs we've got are literally 
exactly the same thing in terms of   chords chord changes and really even just about 
tempo okay we've got um uh sweet home alabama   werewolves of london and all summer long uh 
sweet home alabama of course by leonard skynyrd   werewolves of london by warren zevon and all 
summer long by kid rock so they all do d c g d c g so if we think about like uh 
sweet home alabama you've got this kind of riff going and again if you're far enough 
along and you're playing you should learn how to   do that because it's really fun to do but if 
you're not you're just going to play d c g d c g okay now we've got um warren zivan 
we've got uh werewolves of london that that kind of thing again same thing it's d c g d c g [Music] and all summer long is literally 
exactly the same thing so if you learn how to   play those three chords d c and g with these seven 
different songs even if you took out sweet child   of mine and you took out fall to pieces which 
are tuned differently and you just played these   other five you could play the entire song of 
all of these different songs just playing that   same thing now if you start learning how to move 
those around and play them in a different order   that opens up you know hundreds of other different 
songs that you can play as well and you learn how   to play a couple different chords so you can see 
how you could keep learning more and more songs   by just learning one or two different chords 
but i just wanted to show you something kind   of fun that you can do a couple of different ways 
that you can play your chords and a few different   songs that you could look at that might be fun 
for you so remember stay positive when you're   practicing stay on track you know don't get real 
frustrated and then you know want to quit playing   figure out where your frustration is coming from 
and try and fix that and then come on back and   start practicing whatever it is you were working 
on with these songs the goal is you know if your   first start if you're you're at a stage and you're 
and you're playing where you're just learning how   to play these chords don't worry so much about 
the strumming and everything you could just go d   c g two three four d c g two three four right 
or you know strum half notes one two three   four one or quarter notes excuse 
me one two three four one two three   four like that okay if you were playing something 
like blue on black then you'd have to go d d c g [Music]   you know minimize your strumming until 
you develop those chords a bit more and   then when you're feeling better about 
it you can come back and strum some more   then you can keep adding in [Music] 
you know more stuff and keep going   from there so anyway again stay positive 
keep practicing and i'll talk to you soon
