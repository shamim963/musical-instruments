song tutorial in this lesson I'm going to teach you how to play Something in the orange by Zac Brown which is an awesome acoustic tune for the basics you'll just need your guitar and standard tuning

general then sign up to guitars already hero premium which is my complete step-by-step guitar course all right let's jump into the lesson okay so let's start off the intro now this song is mostly in six eight timings so the count goes one two three four five six we're gonna start with the nice and easy E minor chord shape so index the middle finger on the second Frets of the fifth and fourth string we're going to strum this with a down up down down up down and you can also think of it of just down up down played twice so again the E minor one two three four five six and then we're gonna play three quick notes so I'm just gonna call this riff one and all these notes occur on the sixth string now when we get to riff one the time signature changes from six eight to three eight so this is three eighth notes here so we're gonna hit the second fret of the sixth string we're gonna hit it again and slide up to the seventh so two seven and then open six of the string so one two three then we go to a G chord and we're just going to play that strumming pattern that we had for the E minor but we're going to play it for two strumming patterns so [Music] and the first line of chords for the intro [Music] [Laughter] [Music] for the second line of chords we stay on this G chord we're going to play this for one strumming pattern foreign [Music] number two which is another three notes so we're gonna go up to the seventh fret of the fifth string with our ring finger and then down to the fifth fret and then the open fifth string so those are our three notes and then we go back to our E minor for two strumming patterns and that's it for the intro which is really nice and simple and sounds like this in total foreign [Music] next we get to the verse which is quite simple and it's based around similar chords so we'll start with the E minor and we're going to play this for one strumming pattern so [Music] and then we're going to go to a d slash F sharp so index finger goes on the second fret of the sixth string middle finger on the second fret of the third and ring finger on the third fret of the second string since our d slash F sharp now we're going to play this for basically half of that strumming pattern so again this second bar is three eight timing not six eight timing so we're just gonna play it down up down and then we go to our G for two strumming patterns so the first line of chords foreign [Music] now the second line of chords we have our G for the second line of chords we stay on this G but we're going to slightly change our strumming pattern here we're going to be just strumming all that down strums at those eighth notes so one two three four five six we're then going to go down to a d slash F sharp but we're just going to play this for half a bar of those down strums so one two three and then we go back to our E minor but we're going to return back to our original strong pattern so [Music] okay I'm down so the second line of chords [Music] and the verse in total [Music] now one thing that we can include in our strumming patterns to add more Dynamic is palm muting now to Palm mute you take the fleshy bit of your palm rest it lightly on the edge of the bridge the whilst you're strumming and that gives you that nice muted sound which is quite good in those subtle moments like the verse now when you're Palm unit you want to just pivot that Palm at that point and you want to reduce your range of motion to just the top few strings of the chord so with the down and the up strum motion I'm only hitting really the sixth and fifth strings so together with the Palm mutes the verse would sound like this foreign [Music] so that's with the palm muting and whether you use it or not is completely up to you my suggestion would to be just feel it if you want to take a section of the song Down use power muting if you want to build it up with a lot more power or dynamic then slowly take the Palm unit off next we get to chorus one which is really nice and easy there's two lines of chords here so we have a c chord and then a g and then a d and then an E minor chord now our strumming pattern is going to go down down up down and repeated twice so down down up down down down up down so that's our strumming pattern we're going to play that for each chord you see up here so that first line of chords is repeated through three times and then the second line of Chords it's almost the same except there's two bars of the D so chorus one [Music] foreign [Music] the next thing to learn is chorus 2 which is just the same as chorus one except that first line of chords is played through four times now one thing that you can also add to this chorus is on that c chord for the first down strum you can hammer on your middle finger into place and that adds a bit more of that sort of country vibe [Music] foreign [Music] course is the same as the second chorus except there's no strumming pattern here we're just strumming each chord and holding it out for a full bar there are also two extra chords here to end the song an extra D and an extra E minor and that's everything for this song now in terms of structure it's quite simple we just have the intro that's played through twice and then we have verse one chorus one verse two chorus two and then the final chorus and that's it so now I'll be doing a full playthrough of the song another vocal track on top for some context a big thanks to my friend Eric for learning his awesome vocals to this playthrough feel free to play this back as many times as you'd like to practice play along to and see how you go [Music] thank you [Music] it'll be from my dust cloud I'm telling you baby [Music] these things seen at your bones and drive your young mind crazy [Music] I don't know much but there's no way at all [Music] damnified because if I say I miss you I know that you want foreign [Music] something in the orange tells me we're not done [Music] to
