[Music] thank you foreign foreign Sparks by Coldplay song played on guitar people of the world friends and relatives but we're going to start the song right now on the spot lickety-split you're gonna need a capo so gotta Capo we're gonna put it on the sixth fret if you haven't got a capo you can still play it but it's gonna sound way too deep and low it's gonna sound like oh that sounds [Music] all right it kind of sounds good well now I'm feeling like we should learn without the Capo because that sounded pretty good we're gonna learn it with the Capo the Capo goes on the sixth fret you can still follow along without a capo you're just it's just gonna sound different okay it's gonna sound like this I'm why am I talking about the Capo so much it's ridiculous in addition to using the Capo we also need to tune this bottom string the high E string down a full step to D so that means without the Capo that bottom string should be a d however I recommend just a little tip for when you're using the Capo go and put your Capo on the sixth fret and then double check your tuning sometimes when you put the cape on it squeezes the strings get things out of gets things out of whack I'm gonna cough have you ever heard a weirder cough than that so with the cape on the sixth fret it should be a sharp D sharp G sharp C sharp F and then with his bottom string tuned down G sharp so that's crazy that's a lot of Sharps isn't it let's start learning the song first chord looks like an E minor chord top string is open middle finger second fret on the second string from the top now notice I said second fret even though we're actually up on like the eighth fret with the Capo we count this is one and we count this as two so second fret right there ring finger second fret on the third string from the top the D string the other strings are all open we're not going to worry about the Rhythm right now we're going to keep the Rhythm in a minute but first i'm just going to show you all of the chords to the intro of the song Sparks by Coldplay the band so play this chord for me one time please beautiful job moving on to the second chord we wanna we want the ring finger to play the sixth fret on the second string from the top one two three four five six so this gets a little bit confusing because I think of this as the 12th fret because it's the 12th fret of my guitar but it's the sixth fret from the Capo but we have to think of this as the sixth fret even though it clearly is the 12th fret you even I have my temporary dots on there see because for some reason the maker of my guitar did not put two dots on the 12th fret well it's um Martin never heard of it well anyway they don't put dots on the 12th fret I'm saying a lot of things that don't have anything to do with the song put your ring finger on the sixth fret of the a string the second string from the top put your pointer finger on the fourth fret of the third string from the top also known as the D string now here's something unpleasant that you guys are gonna hate you want to take your thumb reach it up over the top of the neck and then mute the E string I'm gonna cough again but I'm gonna stop the video first it was a brutal cough so now I look a little bit like I was crying but I wasn't I'm not crying I'm not crying uh so you mute the top string with your thumb you've got sixth fret and fourth fret with your ring finger and pointer finger the bottom three strings those High three strings are all open however we actually don't want to hit every single string we'd love to just kind of aim for the middle four strings the middle four strings sound the best if you hit the bottom one no big deal no skin off my back that seems like an expression that probably means something bad I'm gonna stop using it uh let's practice going from this guy up to this guy with the thumb I sounded weird when I did it just then let's do it together shall we one two three here we go one two three one two three not too bad all I mean it was I did fine I don't know how you did one two three one more time one two three one two three beautiful this next transition is quite simple if I do say so myself you've got this chord all ready to go all you're gonna do is slide it one fret up so we were on six and four it looks like twelve and ten I know but we're it's six and four remember we had a whole discussion about this just slide it one fret up so now you're on seven and five even though it looks like thirteen and eleven why am I why am I playing this game with the different Frets I'm just making it more confusing for everyone including myself keep your thumb muting that top string and strum all the strings again like the middle four strings I'm why am I playing all these word games today where I keep I keep saying something and then going that's not what I mean it it's awful oh it's a pretty chords now we've got one two three one two three one two three fantastic I'm gonna have a sip of coffee I'll see you in a minute I ended up having a quick bite of food an additional to my sip of coffee I'm gonna I'm gonna I don't think there's any reason for me to continue living so are you guys ready for another core or what let's learn another chord we're up here on six I know it's not true on seven and five now we're gonna go up to eight and seven so we were using ring finger and pointer finger at least that's what I told you to use I don't know what you were actually using I would like you to slide your ring finger up to the eighth fret on the a string one two three four five six seven eight you might look the Capo confuses things okay so if you just need to actually count the Frets when you're using the K-pop that's fine pretty soon you'll just memorize what it feels like not a big deal but don't be ashamed to just count the Frets okay ring finger on eight of the a string middle finger is on seven of the D string just one string behind it you see that look at that little chord shape nothing wrong with that notice I'm button up against the edge of my guitar over here but I still have room and we're not gonna go any higher than this so we're good to go keep the E string muted strum that chord for me that's a these are all pretty chords so now we've got one two three one two three one two three one two two three it's I'm just gliding along the a string with my ring finger having the time of my life let's learn another chord we're now gonna go to four on the a string with the ring finger and then your pointer finger is gonna play two on the D string the third string from the top continue to mute the E string with your thumb that's a that's kind of a mischievous sounding chord isn't it oh let's play these first one two three four five chords together three beats each one two three here we go one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three this is probably a good spot for you to go all right I'm just gonna practice those five chords a little bit and then I'll come back to this video in a bit when I'm ready to move on let's learn the next thing let's see we go one two three my pick this chord I believe we play for Six Beats or what we'll do is we'll play it twice we'll play it for three baits and then three beats again then you're gonna get rid of your ring finger but keep your pointer finger on the second fret of the D string and then add your middle finger to the third fret of the a string the second string from the top keep muting with your thumb and there's this beautiful cord and then we do my favorite part of the entire song we go like this I just I just love it I think it sounds like a beautiful choir of angels what I'm doing there is I've got that chord we just played where it was third fret on the a string second string from the top second fret on the D string third string from the top muting the E string strum just the middle four strings like we talked about then lift up your pointer finger but keep your middle finger there strum that then lift up your middle finger so we literally just have the open strings but we're muting the E string and then we strum the middle four strings there so it's bling blang long when Coldplay plays this live the guy what's his name I think I know his name I believe his name is Chris Martin the person who invented my guitar he does this he goes I love it I love it like a duck loves moldy bread is that still a thing or is that kill Ducks I'm not sure have I when I was a child and went to the lake and we threw old bread out in the lake for the Ducks was I just murdering Ducks it's entirely possible I don't do it anymore I'm more conscientious about my duck murderers these days guys anyway uh uh what was that talking about oh so here's what he does live and so I'm going to share this little thing with you because I think it's very nice instead of just playing like that we're gonna start with the pointer finger off of the D string strum the chord and then immediately Hammer onto the second fret so it goes like this oh you hear that if you're not familiar with hammer ons that's just where you play string without your finger play or chord or whatever and then right after you play the chord you're just gonna smash your finger down right on the string right on the Fret where you want it to be it takes practice because if you miss or if it bounces off or if something terrible happens it doesn't sound good but you can you can mess around with going you might hear me do that when we play through the song Let's play that is that is the end of the introduction of the song we are not we are now heading into the verse of the song which starts with the v v for verse let's play the intro though all the way through without the strumming pattern one time one two three here we go one two three one two three one two three one two three one three one two same chord one two three we did it we did it what we're gonna do now is we are going to learn the strumming for this part of the song are you prepared for this so I have to confess that in the actual song the strumming changes a little bit throughout sometimes he'll do an extra little strum there an extra little strum there we are just going to learn one consistent pattern so we can just keep the same chill thing going the whole time and then as you get used to playing the song you can maybe add in some special little strumming touches of your own here's going to be our strumming pattern for most if not all of the song I just touched the top of my coffee thing with the bottom of my shoe not sure what I'm gonna do about that what's up our strumming pattern let's get to that E minor chord remember this guy the first one we did get your E minor chord ready I would like you to strum with me down down up down got it one two three here we go down down you did it let's do it just do it twice in a row now so it's gonna be down down up down down exact same thing just twice in a row one two three here we go you just crucial 100 vital that you do that exact strumming the down down up down if you go down up down up then you're screwed then it's not gonna work and you're gonna say this song is dumb it's impossible to play and no one has taught it to me correctly so I need you to strum down down up down the two downs in a row at the beginning down down up down down down down up down down up down down down we're gonna play down down once on each chord in the intro so it's down down down down down up down down down up down down down up down down down up down down down down I we did it twice for this one because remember that one we're doing two times in a row anyway I just lost so much energy I feel like I need to have another bite of food or maybe um or maybe uh maybe some gum people let's keep learning the song does the intro make sense raise your hand if the intro doesn't make sense okay uh great we're good we're good to go now we're into the meat and potatoes of the song the grilled hot albacore depth of the song I decided to say that out loud look at this look I'm gonna let me play something for you you ready [Music] those are like the two main chords of the song it's for the verse it happens at the end of the song it's these two beautiful chords that he does many times in a row check this out would you please put your ring finger on the fifth fret of the second string from the top You Can Count remember the Capo is weird one two three four five it's right there it looks like it's right before the 12th fret that's the 12th that's the fifth fret right there ring finger they're on the fifth fret middle finger plays the fourth fret the Fret right behind it on the third string from the top the D string you see that right there it's a nice little chord shape a nice little chord shape right there and then here's what you guys are gonna hate and it's but it's fun it's fun to do just just get over it just do it your thumb has to come up over the top and we actually want your thumb to push on the third fret of the top string the low E string so ring finger on five pointer middle finger on four some on the third fret of the top string the rest of the strings are open um I really really urge you to try doing with this with your thumb it makes the song just so much more flowing it's fun to do it looks cool it's cool using your thumb up over here but if you refuse to reach your thumb up over the top what you can do you may use your pointer finger to play that note you can do it it's allowed you also can mute the top string with your thumb and just not have the top string making any noise at all okay okay is that a good compromise you're gonna strum down down up down down down up down on this chord so that's twice on this chord one two three down down then we switch we switch to the other chord let me see do I know what it is I do so the top string is now open you're going to get your thumb out of the way entirely top string open your ring fingers on the seventh fret of the a string the second string from the top it looks like it's one fret after the 12th fret but that's the seventh fret and then your pointer finger plays the fifth fret the Fret right on the other side of the twelfth fret right there on the D string the third string from the top top string open bottom strings all open and there's our chord down down up down down up down so we want to do a vamp here what is a vamp is that like a vampire no it's not a vampire it's when you do just a short little musical thing over and over and over again for a while so we're gonna do a little Vamp between the first chord and that second chord just strumming each one twice through the pattern [Music] so things to notice here notice my thumb on the top string I lost the rhyth I'm sorry and then I get rid of my thumb see how my thumb just gets out of the way the other thing to notice is notice how my pointer finger is taken over from my middle finger we've got middle finger doing the work pointer finger doing the work middle finger doing the work pointer finger doing the work let's do this hmm I believe that we should do this four times in a row slowly you and I together you might not get all the chords but you know what you're gonna get some of the chords and then and then you're gonna get better at it one two three here we go one two three down down up down oh Sparks Coldplay two more times oh yeah [Applause] Sparks Chris Martin is his name Chris Martin I feel like I feel like it might be Chris Martin Greg Martin Steve Steve it's Steve Martin I knew it I think his name is Martin Short I believe the lead singer from Coldplay is named Chevy Chase [Music] he played the intro which we discussed then you're actually going to do that vampire that we just did you're gonna do that four times like we just did then the actual verse of the song starts the verse of the song Strong the verse of the song starts with those two chords let's see how many times he goes [Music] a blah blah blah blah twice so in the verse you do that does time Spanish for two surprised you didn't know that and then we're gonna go to this very nice little chord it's a good dissonance oh here's what we do we do it twice then that second chord so we're on the second chord which is open seven five and then open open open up and serious what's gonna happen here it's a little bit of work you can handle it your pinky is going to go to the seventh fret right below your ring finger so keep your ring finger there put your pinky on the seventh fret on the third string from the top right below it take your pointer finger move it to the next string so now it's on the third string From The Bottom the G string and then your thumb is gonna come up and play whatever fret that is the fifth fret on the top string so we've got fifth fret seventh fret seventh fret fifth fret we're also those are all the Frets are all surrounding that 12th fret of your guitar bottom couple strings are still open and that's the chord we're gonna strum down down up down so we actually do that chord four times in a row this Court's kind of tough huh if you need to if your thumb is just not cooperating you may mute the top string with your thumb instead of pushing on the fifth fret but I think it sounds better if you push on the fifth fret Sparks by Coldplay hi my name's Stuart like And subscribe if you find if you find this content to be useful consider liking or subscribing to my YouTube channel hi Sparks by Coldplay after we strum this chord four times through the pattern we're gonna go back to the first chord of the verse that was the three five four chord strumming pattern twice on it down down up down down down up down and then we have what might be our last new chord of the song you've got your fingers in the location of that that first chord you just played it twice then put your pinky right below your ring finger on the fifth fret on the third string from the top and take your middle finger move it down to the next string so now it's on the fourth fret of the G string the third string from the bottom we've got this chord it sounds very similar to the chord we just played Just a little bit different so we're gonna go first chord then switch at this point in the song we start the entire verse all over again let's play the verse together to make sure we all understand how it works so check this out what two three I'll talk us through it first chord twice then up to the fifth and the seventh fret down then back to the first one then up to the second one then the crazy one with the thumb like that we're gonna do this one four times remember then back to the first chord and then that slightly varied first score how'd it go did it go okay did you do you understand the verse uh and then if you recall what I just said a moment ago we just do the whole verse over again we just do the exact same thing another time an additional time as well also it's time for the chorus of the song you're you're like Stuart you just showed me so many chords that I've never heard of in my entire life and now you're expecting me to learn an entire new section of the song well yes and no this next section while it is the chorus it's almost exactly the same as the intro intro remember it it was this thing it was the you're like okay I remember playing it but I don't actually remember how it goes I don't remember how to play it well it sounds to me like you're gonna have to go back and review the intro then because check out here's the chorus we've got our E minor type chord one two three then we go up to six and no six and four is that right yeah sit my computer okay six and four like that remember then you move up to seven and five down down up down then you go up to eight and seven down down up down then you go to four and two down down up down to twice do you remember that kind of sword at like literally honestly truly it's exactly the same as the intro so just go back to the intro and relearn it there instead of me going through the whole thing now I'll just spend all of the time here talking about how you should go back to the intro and learn it all right that's gonna get real Annoying real fast my I found a staple I found a staple on the ground where do you think that came from I'm gonna go ahead and throw it over there we play through the intro again so we're on the here I'm gonna here's the end of the intro we have the fourth fret and the second fret we're going down down up down down down up down then we go to third fret on the a string second fret on the D string now when we learn the intro we went like this what we're going to do here is we're gonna have this chord where it's top strings muted third fret on the a string second fret on the D string we're gonna strum that well at least two times Let's see we go twice we do twice on this without doing any of that fancy we don't do that yet we just do this chord twice through the pattern one two three down down up down then we do the whole intro again this time we do that little fill thing at the end so in case I didn't make myself clear when I said it like ten thousand other times the chorus to the song is exactly the same as the introduction of the song the only difference is that when we get to the last chord we strum it twice and then we play the entire intro over again when we play the intro over again the second time it literally is exactly the same as when we played it in the intro time for the second verse second verse starts off the same as the first verse we play this twice remember that it's exactly the same nothing is different we go to this same crazy cord right here remember this chord so the first half of the second verse exactly the same as the first half of the first verse however the second half of this second verse is a little bit different check it out let's see if I remember it we're going to start off with the same first chord we go down down up down down down and down we go to the same second chord which was the seventh fret and the fifth fret down down up down down down up down but but then you're gonna go like this so we just did the second chord instead of going back to the first chord you're gonna get rid of your ring finger put your middle finger on the fifth fret wait no one two three four five the sixth fret of the a string so we've got top string open sixth fret on the second string from the top and then fifth fret on the third string from the top your pointer finger stays where it was we're gonna strum down down up down on that chord just one time I think no it might be twice I really should plan this out before I do it let's see it's gonna be twice guys it's gonna be twice so two times on pattern one two three one two three then you're gonna move so that both of your fingers are on the one two three four fifth fret is that right look look I have to tell you the K plus the Capo with the dot one two three four five yeah they're both on the fifth fret you have a couple options here because we were just like this with middle finger on six pointer finger on five if you want you can just slide your middle finger over like that to me that sounds a little weird so it is it doesn't sorry sorry let me I misspoke guys I misspoke to me that feels a little weird so what I do is I just relocate my fingers like that I put pointer finger on the a string middle finger on the D string I feel like we've reached the point in the video where I ramble more than usual and I don't make myself clear so how about I play through this this second half of the verse for you watch this it starts with the regular first chord one two three one two three up to the regular second chord then middle finger takes over then fifth fret with both fingers and then we're gonna go to this guy again remember that the regular chord we use in the verse then back to the regular first chord back to the regular last chord of the verse or whatever does that make sense uh then they go back and they play chorus again they play a whole nother chorus and then how does the song end that's right the song ends with them just going just back and forth between those two main chords that we've done a thousand times all right how we doing on time oh we've used to so much time this video is like 87 minutes long should I play through the whole thing let's with the show of hands who thinks I should play through the whole saying thing I why'd I do that stupid thing that doesn't make any sense there's no here's what's gonna happen I'm gonna play through not like the entire songs I don't remember how long the outro goes and stuff I'm gonna play through most of the song it's gonna be boring I'm gonna not talk too much during it just I think you should just leave now and then you can just use this as like a practice thing to play along with or whatever just just leave oh look at that I got some good news some good news about our real ID appointment at the DMV a one two three from the top Sparks [Music] here's our van we're gonna do this four times two oh here's the third time one more [Music] then here is where the singing starts it goes a blah blah blah blah that's not me making fun of him like he's a good singer that's just it's just what I felt like doing it was annoying okay look at this remember that chord you're like I don't remember any of this dude don't call me dude call me um I don't know you can call me dude we're at the second half of the first verse now oh Coldplay [Music] I think I did that was that the right number of times maybe I might have messed up look if I messed up contact my lawyers okay hey get ready for the chorus here comes the chorus now foreign [Music] I blew the Dismount there we're in the second verse now wait actually we're in like the second interlude because we haven't been singing for the second verse hasn't started we're just doing our little vampire before we go into the next part we got one more little vampire here now the second verse is officially starting the Sparks spark spark Sparks and watch this this guy this chord we all know and love my sunglasses just fell okay now here's the second half of the verse this is where things get interesting first chord is regular second chord is regular this chord is not regular we made it and we go to the chorus skin guys and I'm gonna stop there because nothing else new happens in the song this has been Sparks by coldplayers kicked all my equipment the time has come to me to bid toward you a farewell unto With Thine for thusly have a great weekend when I don't know when this is coming out it might be like a Monday and then that made no sense and then you could be watching at a different time I should have stopped talking ages ago
