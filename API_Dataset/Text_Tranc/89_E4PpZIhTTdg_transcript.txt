you kind of don't need to play the exact cramps oh [Music] Crepes by Radiohead if you are a Zero Bar chord way to play the song Tough I'm not going to show it to you there you could use a capo and you could do it without Barre chords or this you could take advantage of this great opportunity to perfect the fine and ancient art of playing Barre chords on the guitar standard tuning we're in standard tuning friends and relatives you need to be in standard tuning and you need to also um have a pick you don't have to have a pick but I but hey we're playing bar chords playing with a pick Planet the way the Radiohead intended first chord we need is a bar chord called a g bar chord pointer finger is going to play the third fret on the top string of the top string your ring finger plays the fifth fret on the second string from the top string second second string pinky plays fifth fret on the third string from the top middle finger plays fourth fret on the third string from the bottom so again starting from the top string up here we're going three five five four something to keep in mind when you're playing bar chords don't have your thumb up over here over the top like you you technically can play a bar chord with your thumb up over the top but what you want to do is bring your thumb back like this let's get an alternate View see where my thumb is guys see where my thumb is look at that it's like I'm pinching together my thumb and my pointer finger with the guitar in between let's see see what I'm saying you see what I'm saying you see what I'm saying you're actually gonna push with your thumb push with your thumb on the neck of the guitar and then your pointer finger is gonna push against your thumb as well all right I'm very upset it's time for us to take this pointer finger and just Smash It Down on all the strings you can see where my finger is where the tip of my finger is coming up over the top of the guitar you could do it where you're just right flush with the top of the neck but I recommend having your fingers stuck up a little bit it might even be easier to have your finger come up even more you can experiment with different ways there but I just have you know it looks like about a centimeter of my finger sticking up over the top it just gives me the best leverage here's another tip guys as you are pushing with your thumb pushing with your pointer finger you can also with your this your arm over here your picking arm if you push against the body of the guitar almost like you're trying to break your guitar in half by pushing it against your chest don't try to break your car your car in half by pushing your guitar against your chest hi my name is Stuart like And subscribe if you found this content about breaking your car by pushing on your guitar helpful I've got other Radiohead tutorials you can check them out um but uh what was I saying I was talking about crushing your guitar so if you push here and then you're pushing with your hand push it with your thumb now you've got all these different things pushing the strings against your finger giving you the best chance of getting that nice crisp clear bar chord sound another thing to be very aware of make sure the tips your fingers are right up against the Frets don't let them go to the middle of the Fret you're gonna start getting this sound I don't want that sound do you want that sound get him right up against the edge and then it should sound a little something like this guys it sounds like the first chord to Creep by Radiohead yeah I know I'm spending a lot of time talking about this one chord but that's because there's only four chords in this song so and they're pretty much all the same chord so if you get good at this one then you're good at all of them God G major bar chord welcome to Crepes by Radiohead remember when I said that that was pretty funny crepe is like a breakfast dessert not a song so this is a G major chord going for right now we're just gonna strum it oh it sounds great guys such a good job and then you're gonna take this very same chord shape this is what we in the the uh the guitar industry we call this the E bar chord shape the reason why is because these fingers here are making the shape of an E chord an E chord and you scooch it up at your pointer finger G bar chord oh so much fun you're gonna take this e bar chord shape and you're gonna move it one two three four Frets up the neck of the guitar so now your pointer finger is on seven on all six strings ring finger is on nine pinkies on nine and middle finger is on eight pointer finger is gonna Smash down do all those things remember where's your thumb is it almost hit the microphone sorry it's just what is this that's the best way to do that that's where my thumb is that's right there and maybe I'll do my little push on the guitar here I'm pushing with my fingers got everything going oh if it doesn't sound quite right maybe I'll just kind of move this around a little bit try to get it just right oh this is a B major bar chord guys G major going to B major what do you say we practice those two chords we're just gonna strum each one we're gonna count to four in between each chord one two here we go and one two three here we go one two let's go back to the other one here we go one [Music] up to the B o three four up to the B up to the B whatever happened to that I don't remember the name of that person the song hi did I already say subscribe whenever I say something that is a complete waste of time that's when I feel inspired to say oh subscribe to the channel guys take the same chord move it one fret over so now we're on ten no wait sorry now we're on eight with the pointer finger ten with the ring finger and Pinky and nine with the middle finger this is a c bar chord but Uncle Stewart why am I playing the seal couldn't I do it over here yeah sure this is a c you could do it there but two things one it's not how Radiohead does it it doesn't sound quite right two do you want to get good at bar chords or not feel like when people like when like when I was a kid and people were saying I needed to learn how to drive stick shift a stick shift car and I'm like I don't want to guess what I never did it has never affected me ever I say you gotta learn bar chords you know what you could do fine not learning bar chords who am I to tell you that you have to drive a bar chord car I feel like I've been awake for six weeks B Bar chord no shoot I messed up G bar chord on the third fret B Bar chord on the seventh fret c bar chord on the eighth fret when I say what fret I'm talking about what fret my pointer fingers on and then one more chord and that's literally the only chords in this song is we need to learn a C minor bar chord here's how you do that you have your c bar chord here ready to go you're going to get rid of your middle finger just your middle finger this is now a C minor bar chord but wait there's more if you take your middle finger and Smash down onto your pointer finger now you have the strength of two fingers smashing down on that eighth fret which makes the bar chord so much easier which is good because this minor bar chord the hardest note in this chord is the third string from the bottom go ahead and play the third string from the bottom for me does it sound like this yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought that means you're gonna need to push harder because we want it to sound like that now you can just push harder with your pointer finger and your middle finger another thing you can do is when you switch to the minor bar chord you can take these fingers and move them up even more and try to get your knuckle of that finger lined up with that third string from the bottom that's what I do so if I'm playing the C you see where my pointer finger is then when I switch to the C minor watch this oh you see how I have nudged everything up a little bit note sounds crystal clear all right we've learned that the main chords we're gonna play through those we're gonna practice them that's where most of the work is going to be it's just learning those chords but we are going to talk about the picking we are going to talk a little bit about strumming we're going to talk about a couple other little air variations but those are the only actual chords in the song what do you say we play them through one single solitary time one two get the G chord ready two two three stay there and get ready switch to the seventh fret here we go B chord two three four five six just up one fret and one two that's the C Isn't it nice C minor here we go see minor record and then it just starts over again and that's how you play the main chords to creeps by radioheads let's do all the picking the picking soap here's what I have to say about the picking for the song they do not stick to an exact pattern with the picking for this song they're kind of they're going like this they're going [Music] and I've listened to a bunch of live recordings I don't need to brag or anything but I've seen Radiohead live like three times and I like paid attention and wanna wait they actually they usually don't play this song live but when I saw them they played it live and it was a special event and it was very very exciting very exciting times guys I mean you know I'm cool about that because I saw Radiohead Play Creep am I a hero because I saw already I'd play Creep for me to decide but the point I'm making is that they change it up they don't play the same picking pattern that's why I'm going to show you right now though is I'm going to show you what they play note for note exactly the first time through the chords I recommend you just practice that exact pattern so you get the right technique then as you get more comfortable with it you can kind of you might you might switch up some of the notes you'll just get a feel for it you can do some stuff it's going to be great get the first chord ready that G major chord here's what's gonna happen you're gonna play the top string with your pick then you're gonna play a second string then you're gonna play the third string from the top but if at all possible I would like you to pick up on that third string from the top so it's down down up down down up down down up great job then you're gonna go back to the second string from the top and pluck down so now we've got down down up down one two three four down down up down so good now you're going to play the third string from the top again looking down this time then you're gonna play the third string from the bottom plucking up [Music] great let's try it one more time that's I know yeah yeah one two here we go and down down up down down up the reason I am changing the direction of my picking is because I am always trying to pick in the direction of the next string I'm going to play you call that directional picking it's something that you don't really need to think about it just starts happening automatically but you have to put a little bit of effort to into it at first so you don't have to focus on this for the whole song If you just plug down on everything that's okay it still sounds fine don't worry about it but if you're feeling ambitious feeling like developing a new important skill in this stage in your life you can go down down up down down up okay I'm gonna stop calling out the directions now okay we just played that third string from the bottom at this point in time what's going to happen is there's a tiny little half beat little breath where you just get to wait for a second and then you're gonna play the third string from the top again and then you're gonna jump to the second string from the bottom so here's what we just did we did [Music] together one two three four so nice Okay okay let's take it from there we just played that second string with the bottom then you're gonna play Third String from the bottom then fourth string from the bottom then back to the third string from the bottom so that was how's your hand doing over here is your thumb falling off probably your thumb is probably about ready to fall off it hurts it's actually not a sensation like it's gonna fall off that's just it's just the expression we use when our thumb hurts okay we just went then there's another little pause a little half b a little break it's actually kind of a full beat break this time we really get a chance to take take a little breath and then you're gonna play second string from the bottom then third string from the top so bang bang sounds like this how'd you do them now I know what you're thinking Uncle Stewart I can't remember all these all these different strings how am I supposed to keep track of exactly what string I'm supposed to play in that order exactly yeah that's kind of the point I was making earlier you kind of don't need to play these I just had the weirdest cramp spasm thing I've ever higher life oh what happened I need more electric lights if you play the wrong string it's okay because all of the strings sound good even if you change up the Rhythm and and all that sort of stuff as long as you're feeling the beat of the song it's gonna be okay vague I know it's vague those are the vague instructions I'm showing you the specific thing try to do the specific thing but if you kind of start going into that vegu make stuff up Direction it's okay as long as it sounds good to you all right now we're done with the G chord moving up to the B chord that was the one up on the seventh fret we're gonna go like this this I like this part this part we have a little fancy little thing we're gonna do is great I think I just kicked the camera ever so slightly we're gonna be okay you're gonna play the top string then you're gonna play the second string for the top then you're gonna jump down to the third string from the bottom so that was top second from the top third from the bottom then go back to the second from the top so one two three four then third string from the top and then third string from the bottom and then back to second string from the top that was a lot listen to this let's do it again one two here we go that part's actually not too bad to play it's kind of fun okay then here's where the fancy things comes in here is where the fancy thing happens take your pinky and move it one string down like that so see how I just took my pinky Blue Lamp Boop like that you're gonna play that string the third string from the bottom then immediately go to the second string from the top then put your pinky back and play the third string from the bottom again so that was like this there's a little teeny little breath in there we go and then three more notes You're Gonna Play second from the top third from the bottom third from the top so as pinky regular second so everything we just did on the B chord was like this [Music] do you like it do you like it I did it just for you you're gonna love this next part we take that B chord we move it up to the C remember the C chord with a pointer finger on the eighth fret we are going to do that exact same pattern we just did on the B chord on this c chord so that means it's going to go like this so we got on the B then C thank you you're getting the hang of it guys finally it's time for the C minor get the C minor chord ready to go we're gonna go like this second string from the top then jump down to the third string from the bottom this is the note that might sound like that here's another I would like to make a deal with you would you make a deal with me if your minor chord does not sound good right away what I would like you to do is just play the notes play the strings with it not sounding very good and get used to that and as time goes on the notes will sound better and better so that means your minor chord might sound like this [Music] that's okay for right now you're just gonna have to live with it if you sit there and obsess over getting every note to sound good I mean you can do that every once in a while but mostly you just want to be able to keep playing the song and just and just trust that it's going to get easier okay so second string from the top then you're going to play the third string from the bottom then third from the top then second from the bottom so that was there look at my pick look at this I'm going oh it's hard to see here we go okay then you're gonna do third from the bottom and just go up up like this and then go to the third from the top so it was can we try all those notes together one two here we go [Music] okay okay almost done seconds ring from the top again third string from the bottom up to the next one third from the top second from the top and then you're just gonna go again so we're just doing those three strings a bunch of times it goes [Music] that's the picking for the verse you guys let's play the whole verse all the way through once give your thumb a second if you do not play all of the exact same notes that I play that's okay that's how Radiohead does it I mean in the recording they play it like this but when they're just playing the song they don't always play the same notes that's that's the point I'm trying to make I'm trying to make that point so many times you guys understand it but I haven't accepted that you understand it yet oh my frame rate's getting a little weird I think it's because my battery is dying one and two and one two here's the verse thank you pinky pinky Miner foreign guys we did it should we talk about the chorus the verse they just do that over and over and over and over and over and over the chorus a couple things happen in the chorus we've got the same basic chords but what we are going to do is switch them to power chords what we are not going to play 100 the uh Johnny Greenwood Green River Green Green River Killer the Johnny Johnny green wood would green and the other guy whose name is like Damon McIntosh that's not his name I considering radiohead's one of my favorite bands I really should know the names of the members oh well I know there's Brothers Colin is one of them but not the one I'm talking about hi my name is Stuart welcome to the channel like And subscribe for the third time all right at this point in time let's uh let's do the right before the chorus right before the chorus happens there's those I'm doing it on acoustic guitar right now but if you're on like a super distorted electric guitar it sounds even better what you're gonna do is you are going to with your entire hand all of your fingers you're going to just kind of fan them out you're gonna touch all of the strings do it over here like over on the first second and third Frets don't do it up here because then it'll start sounding you'll start getting some notes if you're over here it's just gonna sound really muffled and beefy do not push if you push at all it's gonna sound like that you just want to touch the strings if it sounds like this that means even though you're pushing I mean you're just touching lightly with most your fingers it means the base of your fingers is just coming down a little bit too hard on the bottom string so just make sure you're just lightly touching you're gonna go like this you're gonna go one two down up like that super hard one two down up down up down up he does it three times so let's do that one more time it's one two down up down up he doesn't like I think guys I think it might be for show a little bit I don't think he has to hit the strings with literally all of his shoulder strength but that's what he does and uh you know what and then he did the soundtrack to There Will Be Blood which was a which was a fantastic movie it's a movie with not much talking and just a lot of people being depressed and miserable my That's my kind of thing for the chorus we're just gonna be like this [Music] it's here's what it is it's those bar chords but we don't need to bar I'm just doing third fret on the top string fifth fret second string from the top fifth fret third string from the top my pointer finger is not smashing down on all the strings it's just touching those bottom strings to mute them and I go one two three four it's much easier a break for my fingers than you up to seven three four five six then up to eight two three four then eight again and two three four five six seven eight also they don't do this on the recording but there's so much stuff happening with the recording with the two guitars and extra stuff if you want to add a little bit more beef to it if you're playing it by yourself just strum eighth notes on the guitar what I mean by that is instead of doing one strum per chord go [Music] and here's another thing you can do for that last chord we can kind of mix the two guitar parts into one and instead of just staying on that eight fret power chord what you can do is bring your pointer finger up to 11 on the top string have your pointer finger just lay flat and have it mute the second string from the top then play 13 on the third string from the top what we're doing here is what that is is that's the minor third of our C minor chord which just basically we get that C minor sound without having to play a whole C minor chord so that's the chorus uh so we're not learning the solo because I'm allergic to guitar solos unfortunately um so that was just like the verse is the quiet little picking the chorus is the bill strumming also if you wanted to sing and play the song at the same time it's tough for you to do that picking and sing you can also just strum the bar chords guys you can go sounds nice just be nice and gentle with it and then when you get to the chorus you just go like that and you know some this is my pick and [Music] um
