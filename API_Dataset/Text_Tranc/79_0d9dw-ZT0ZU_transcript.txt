[Music] foreign [Music] guys this is the Velvet ring by a Velvet Underground Velvet Revolver velvet ring by oh bye bye Big Thief I was playing with you the whole time guys such a fun time we have together where I pretend I don't know anything and you go why am I watching this video okay so this you're gonna love playing this song it is not as hard as it sounds but but but but but there is one thing or an open D tuning so here's the deal you gotta get your tuner I'll have my video where I show you how to do alternate tunings but here's what open D tuning is you have your top string tuned down to a d then have your second string from the top tuned down to an a your third string from the top remains its normal D the third string oh excuse me the third string from the bottom you tune down a little bit to an F sharp the second string from the bottom you tune down to an A and the bottom string you tune down to a d so just use your tuning app or tuner of choice okay you're gonna go into that tuning I like I said there's a whole video I'll put the thing up in the thing with the stuff to help you through this you can do it get into this alternate open D tuning it's very fun you're gonna love it now unfortunately you also need to put a capo on the fifth is it the fifth fret or is it the fourth I just spit on my guitar well I need to check where the Capo goes because I forget Capo's on five just like I said and then now we're not gonna use a pick we're just games our fingers let's the first part is the easiest most fun part so you play the top string open with your thumb great then you jump down to the third string from the top you play that open with your thumb fantastic then with your pointer finger play the third string from the bottom so I'm just kind of grabbing the bottom of the string and doing this like trigger motion I don't know how do you pull a trigger I imagine it's kind of like that so I'm going thumb thumb finger then I'm going back to thumb on the third string from the top so that's thumb thumb finger thumb let's just do that a couple times just to get the juices flowing why did I say that one two here we go thumb thumb finger thumb one more time here we go thumb thumb finger thumb okay then after that your middle finger plays the second to bottom string open then your thumb goes back to the third string from the top and then your pointer finger plays the third from the bottom and then your thumb plays a third from the top again so that was thumb thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb we're going to be doing a lot of this so get used to it sweetheart one two play it with me and boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom see how this hand over here doesn't have to do anything so it's being as lazy as possible I'm like it's just leaning into chair I'm let's Hank okay so you do that once you'll get faster at it don't worry just practice this song extremely slowly at first okay then after you do that once put your middle finger on the fourth fret of the top string it's the fourth fret from the capos like this is one this is two this is three this is four You're Gonna Play top string with fourth fret with your thumb then have your thumb jump down to the third string from the top plate open pointer finger plays third from the bottom open and then third thumb plays third from the top open so that was top thumb pointer thumb then move your finger to the fifth fret on the top string and do the exact same picking thumb thumb pointer thumb guys we have just learned the intro to the song we have also learned what I'm going to affectionately call the main Riff to the song which is called velvet ring by Big Thief I got it on my first try that time aren't you proud of me hello my name is Stuart welcome to the channel like And subscribe if you haven't play I like seriously seriously guys I would like I would like like I mean I think it would be great if by the end of the day today I got to 10 million subscribers so like And subscribe share engagement uh proactivity um Encyclopedia Brown just just start saying random things um let's play that whole thing shall we very slowly one two three four four [Music] and it starts over again that's not too bad right I mean it's not the easiest thing in the world but you can do it so they do this three times in a row but what I really want to do now is I want to see if we can get it the tiniest bit faster the rhythm is not confusing the rhythm is just a constant consistent Rhythm but we gotta get it fast we gotta get the right string so let's do it like this speed let's go [Music] almost forgot [Music] to give fourth fret what could do fifth fret Bucky poop great you did a great job we do that three times like I said then to finish up the little main riff thing we go like this play four on the second string from the top you're gonna play with your thumb play that note then you can use your thumb or your finger it's up to you I use thumb I go thumb on that note then I go down to the third string from the top play that open then pointer finger plays the third string from the bottom open and then back to third string from the top so that was second from the top third from the top third from the bottom back to Third from the top then move your finger to the third fret do the exact same picking then go to the second fret do the same picking then to go to the first fret and do the same picking so that is the intro how about we play the intro all the way through one dough here we go and oh this is gonna take forever fourth fret fifth fret oh no we started it over because we're doing it three times remember fourth fret fifth fret oh this is the last time then here we go four on the second string three two and you slow it down right here there's a on though where you just slow down the speed of the song guys we have now learned the intro um should we learn the first verse oh guess what you already learned the first verse it's literally the exact same thing you do that main part three times and then you go four three two one and shove the kitchen of the city tomb what is I have no idea what the song is about all right second verse second verse is almost the same you do that main that main picking thing three times again exactly the same there's only one little difference when we get to this part instead of going four three two one we're gonna go three two one zero Blast Off let's do it here we go and three two one zero so that's when she sings and he was not the only one now at this point in time we're gonna go on to the next section but I'm gonna stop the video first because I need to turn the page but I don't want you to know that I have a little cheat sheet here that tells me the sections so I'm just going to cut that part out people of the world friends and relatives we have made it to the chorus of the song I love this part but it is I have to confess a kind of a difficult part of the song it's kind of confusing so you're gonna put your middle finger on the second fret of the Third string from the bottom okay okay then you're going to pinch together using your thumb and whatever finger you want I use my pointer finger you're going to pinch together the top string and the third string from the bottom which is the string you're pushing on over here you pinch them together it sounds like this it's a little it's a little dissonant it's cool though so you pinch those together then your thumb plays a third string from the top and then whatever finger you want middle pointer ring pinky don't use your pinky any but yeah pretty essentially any finger you want it's going to play the second string from the bottom open what do I do I use my middle finger so I go pinch thumb middle on the second from the bottom then my thumb goes back up to the third from the top so watch this watch watch just shop and watch we go no no no we go [Music] see what that was it was pinch thumb middle thumb top and third from the bottom third from the top second from the bottom back to the third from the top we do that then you're gonna use your ring finger to play the third fret on the third string from the bottom and do the exact same picking then slide up to the fifth fret on the third string from the bottom do the exact same picking [Music] and then you can use either your ring finger or your pinky I think I use ring finger go up to the seventh fret and do the same thing so that was two three [Music] five seven very pretty right when we get a little faster [Music] very cool I mean sorry very cool now you're gonna stay on that seven with your ring finger but with your pointer finger play five on the top string you might think the K plus screws things up one two three four five it's right there it's right there you're gonna do the same picking then with your middle finger play seven on the top string but it looks like the 12th fret because of the Capo situation do the same picking all right then you're gonna stretch down to four on the top string do the same picking then you move back up to five on the top string and do the regular picking again okay great great we're doing fine so far then here's what's gonna happen you're gonna do the picking on five again go up to seven again down to four again and then we go back to five and do the picking four times one two three four that's how you count to four and that's fit for the chorus should we play the whole chorus all the way through let's do it we'll do it slowly one two here we go and pinch three three five five seven five on the top seven on the top four on the top five on the top stay there five on the top seven four then five four times two three four great oh some of you guys you you did so good you were scared but look at how well you did see you're growing up your deer doing great now we go back to the verse versus exactly the same as the other verses we go we do that three times and then and then okay so we do that three times but then for the little descending part where we go the way we're gonna do it this time is you're gonna play five on the second string then four then two then one almost I got a little choked up there you guys very emotional about the first fret so um that's paid they're little like twist they do is they just at the end of each verse they throw us a little curveball on how they're gonna do the little thing we are now at the final verse of the song it starts off with the regular verse thing I feel compelled to play it every time I say that and then for our little descending thing this time we're gonna go three two one zero but we're gonna do it two times oh you weren't expecting that I just want to take you home is what they sing then we do the chorus again it's like that so we do that whole chorus yours is thicker than a velvet ring guys I wonder what that means do you think it's dirty I don't know then we get to the outro outro is kind of weird the outro we're gonna go like this middle finger 15th is that right 15th fret on the top oh shoot the Capo screws everything up look here's the deal it's the 15th fret of the actual guitar but it's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten from the Capo so what however you want to think of it middle finger right on that fret ring finger is gonna play the same fret on the third string from the bottom pinky plays the same fret on the second string from the bottom you're going to pinch together the top string and the second string from the bottom then your thumb jumps down to the third string from the top so it's like that we're going pinch thumb all right you see how I just checked out right here so we got pinch thumb we're gonna do that one two three four five six times six times then take this same exact shape move it one two Frets over so now you're on like 17th fret of the guitar I guess like 12th fret from the Capo and do the same thing twice so it's one two three four five six one two at this point in time you're gonna go to the fourth fret on the top string you're gonna go like this so that was just thumb on the top then you go boom boom that same thing we've been doing the whole time then go to the fifth fret and go so it's four five then we're gonna go see then you're gonna go like this you're gonna go the same picking powder we're doing is top string third from the top pointer finger back to Third from the top second from the bottom then boom boom boom yeah look I'm I'm just pretty much done okay then if you want everyone's a while they go like this and play the bottom string so the outro is like um [Music] some it's something like that and then you probably just end it by going strongly open strings they have a whole big like weird ethereal Cosmic outro That We're Not Gonna Do we're done bye bye have a good time see you when you get back foreign [Music]
