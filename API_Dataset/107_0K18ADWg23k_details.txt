    "Transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hey what's up you guys Marty Schwartz here with Marty music gonna break down this classic Smashing Pumpkins song I still remember when it came out I'm old anyway thanks for supporting Marty music and also if you could click that Bell button there bye subscribe to really appreciate that anyway let's learn the tune alright we want our guitar tuned down a half step so we'll sound like this [Music] and we're going to do this little octave thing here which would be sixth fret a string and then eighth fret g string and you're letting your index finger mute the the D string in between them and it's muting the B and high E so I'm not barring I'm just letting the finger touch or drape across the strings to mute the ones I don't want now with this riff we want the open E string in there and we're gonna start with down down down down down down down down and then we go up a half-step with this little shape to the seventh fret then to the second fret all with this open e ringing out with it one more time a little bit slower [Music] so now what we're doing is we're going to be doing a little move up and down the D string with the open a ringing out and we're gonna let our thumb just kind of ride along cruising around to mute that east ring you know you're not having to press it's just there to kind of so we get this open a string and D string so I'm using my ring finger on the sixth fret of the D the a string is ringing out with it doing a half step Bend and you got to pull it downward to get the open a to ring out smoothly so then I'm going to for two on the D string with the open a ringing out and my index finger is kind of lightly muting the higher string so we're really just it's a to note pattern the open a ringing out with this movement it goes back up so Bend 4 2 4 6 9 9 so you go up to that ninth fret on that D string and [Music] the rhythms also not cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha anymore [Music] put them together [Music] so the next part it's an f-sharp minor to a B major typically you see that like something like here which it is gonna be here for part of the song the power chords up but we're gonna do this little shape I saw Julie Corrigan doing live acoustically and it's just another way to play this F sharp minor chord so you've got 9th fret a 7th fret D 9th fret G and then you let the B and high e ring out [Music] then you play your be classic B bar shaped bar chord but if you let the B and highiy ring out there you get this to put them together [Music] and the being high earring out for different elements of this song so you put that together with the original riff [Music] so now we need there's definitely more than one guitar going on here so let's go with the e power chord so you have to read on the a string seven nine nine but then the bean hi you ringing out oops that sounded bad sorry [Music] so now what's happening is this little passing cord and you can think of it is the roots going down a half step so [Music] and so what's gonna happen is you can either play sixth on the a and nine on the D as a power chord or you can also add your ring finger [Music] - to that to that eight fret G and then the hi-yi and B can ring out for the easy ways just thinking of it as a power cord or you can go and still do the same index and pinky but then you have to add your ring finger then the octave here on the second fret a and fourth fret G just like the other part of the song so you got and then right into the part we already learned [Music] [Applause] [Music] now if you're playing with another guitar player there's another thing you can do you could go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you know different combinations instead of the you could play an A [Music] a suspended - it's just having that open be bring out you could also do a thing like this where [Music] and you just play the octaves of the six and eight on the G with the open being high e ringing out [Music] so you get that more jangly part of it [Music] see that the D strings being muted through that [Music] this part again [Music] goes through everything again but this time instead of it's just gonna be a f-sharp [Music] down here because it slides up to the fifth fret now you could go like this and what I'm doing is I'm letting the B and high e ring out just like this voicing of that f-sharp but what I'm doing is I'm just letting my middle finger mute the g string so you're not it's really still a power chord it's not that's the porno for Pyro's chords by the way no we're just muting so that's what's different the bridge comes in from the and so it's gonna be a B power cord and once again let the B and high e ring out if you like up a whole step to c-sharp [Music] to the a or a sus to [Music] all right I hope you enjoyed the lesson really appreciate it if there's any requests you have for any type of lesson at all let me know in the comments below and while you're down there don't forget to Like and subscribe to marty music thanks so much hope to see you real soon [Music] [Music]"
