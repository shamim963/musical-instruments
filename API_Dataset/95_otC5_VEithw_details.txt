    "Transcript": "[Music] from the start by Levy people of the world's friends and relatives you're never gonna believe this but I Stuart Alexander Layman Brown have had a kind of a rough day I was long story short my fingernails are disgustingly filthy there's only so many times in a day that a human person can wash his or their hands also I'm only wearing one shoe the other shoe is right here well get that's a story for another day to play the song you need to be in standard tuning and we're mostly going to use three chords but there are two other bonus chords were oh God look at my hands ignore them just whatever put your middle finger on the sixth fret of the second string from the top then put your pointer finger on the fourth fret of the third string from the top then put your ring finger on the sixth fret of the third string from the bottom and your pinky on the sixth fret of the second string from the bottom this is an E minor nine chord we're going to use it so many times so you need to get good at it and you need to remember the name of it E flat as I say E flat minor nine I don't remember I may have called an E minor nine this is an E flat minor nine some people like to have their thumbs back here and then they have their fingers kind of spread out here what I like to do is I bring my thumb over the top and see how my pointer finger and my middle finger kind of touching it's it feels at first like it's going to be impossible it's not it's fun it is legitimately one of my favorite chords E flat minor nine Pop Quiz what's the name of this chord you all failed you get F's it's an E flat minor nine on This chords you're gonna put your thumb on the second string from the top with your pointer finger grab onto the bottom of the third string from the top with your middle finger grab on to the third string from the bottom and with your ring finger grab on to that second string from the bottom so we're just kind of pinching those together right now we're not using the top or bottom strings at all just those middle four strings I personally what I like to do is I take this part of my hand and I just kind of put it right here it's like my little anchor it keeps everything still so I'm not floating around some people like to be floating around like this for me it feels weird some people also like to have their pinky right here both totally legit you can do both of those you can do them both the same time maybe I don't know if that's physically possible but I left this part of my hand right here boom right there here's the Rhythm we want we want so that's like slow fast fast slow or something who cares it goes one two three four slowly I'll play it one more time great job at this point we're gonna switch to an A flat 13 chord here's how you do that you're gonna lift up every finger except for your pinky your pinky stays in the same spot but lift up all the other ones Pinky's still there have you Pop Quiz have you moved your pinky if you said yes then you weren't paying attention keep your pinky there pointer finger goes to the fourth fret on the top string middle finger fourth fret third string from the top so we're skipping that second string from the top we're ring finger fifth fret third string from the bottom pinky is on the sixth fret of the second string to the bottom remember we didn't move the pinky guys we didn't even move it at all died yeah here's okay a flat 13 chord guys here's a little thing just in case you're curious I don't know who cares about this but let me just really quickly you know that E flat minor nine chord check this out you know we've got this note in there look at this if I play the E flat minor scale it's okay if you don't know it but if I go one two three four five six seven eight nine that's the ninth note of the scale that's why it's an E flat minor nine because we added in that ninth note of the scale and then this a flat 13 chord look one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen that no to the scale so now now you know something about Nothing chords on this chord s chord play so now your thumb goes up to the top string middle finger no so why do I I keep calling this like the 17th time I've called this a middle finger this would be vulgar if it was a middle finger um so you've got your a flat 13 chord thumb is on the top string skip the second string put your pointer finger on the third string from the top middle finger on the string right below that ring finger on this ring right below that so we're grabbing those together and you're gonna play it's just like slow fast fast so now when we put those together we've got let's do it together one two I'm gonna try to stop saying but I make no guarantees one two three four that's worse one more time here we go and [Music] we go to our third and maybe most important chord it's the d flat major seven chord you're gonna put your pointer finger on the fourth fret with the second string from the top ring finger sixth fret third string from the top middle finger fifth fret third string from the bottom and Pinky on the sixth fret of the second to bottom string wait a minute wait a minute you guys pinky on the sixth fret of the second to bottom string are you telling me that we don't have to move the pinky for this whole part because that's exactly what I'm telling you so it sounds like we're telling each other the exact same thing we got Discord going to this chord going to Discord pinky just stays in the same place guys on this chord we're gonna play so it's the Sameer than we oh okay whatever we go I was gonna say slow fast fast slow slow if that helps just kind of like slow fast fast slow slow that's how I'm gonna explain rhythms from now on let's play it from the beginning one two nice and slow [Music] one more time that is the intro to the song it's the intro you just do that one time for the intro then the singing starts but we're gonna use those same three chords and that same basic Rhythm quite a bit so once the singing starts we actually start off by playing the exact same thing we go but then when we go to this chord what was it called that's right a d flat major seven chord we're gonna change the Rhythm up and the picking and the Rhythm up for this chord instead of going we're gonna go like this [Music] let me do that one more time then I'll explain it to you is [Music] we've got the same exact cord over here I'm going thumb on that second string from the top and then I'm going to just the three fingers on those next three strings so I'm going boom yeah one two three four [Music] then we go bunker again but it's faster so we go [Music] thumb fingers thumb fingers one two play with me one two one more time then we're gonna go so that's going to be fingers then thumb then fingers again kabanka sounding dangerously close to Something in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would say Michelangelo specifically um so we've got bunka bunka bunker two three four finger fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb figures one more time thumb fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers one more time sorry it's a bad habit of mine I say one more time and then I do it several more times a lot of Shadow today what in the world just happened did something just I think my my YouTuber light system over here just fell that's partly because it's held up with masking tape which is oh okay hi my name's Stuart welcome to the channel like And subscribe um at this point in time let's finish up this uh we just did good Cowabunga or whatever kabanka then you're gonna do fingers one more time and then you're gonna go like this you're gonna play second string from the top then you're gonna go to the fifth fret on the second string from the top and then we're gonna go back to the E flat minor nine so that's a lot of stuff down that d flat major seven chord we went [Music] I messed everything up I'm sorry I apologize let's try that one more time one two three [Music] four five let's take it from the beginning from the E flat minor nine right at the beginning of this like singing part one two three [Music] here we go [Music] four five one two one more time friends boom wow the air conditioning just turned on can you hear it I'm sure you can hear it It's gotta be definitely loud what are we gonna do I've decided we're just going to continue with the air conditioning running it's very unprofessional but you know Chance's arm most people have stopped watching anyway and this way at least I can be less sweaty so I think it's a win-win situation I don't know what win-win means apparently also there's a chance that no one can even hear it and it just sounds like I'm being ridiculous sounds like sounds like I'm being ridiculous really quick recap we have our intro [Music] that's all that is intro done great then we get to I'm just gonna call it the a section the a section is where the singing starts it's where we do that so that first little part of those first stopped could you notice okay great we play those three chords E flat minor nine a flat 13 and D major seven with that Rhythm then we do the exact same thing again we just do it twice in a row after you play that part two times then we're gonna go on to something a little different we're gonna start off with the same chords but it's got a little bit of a different Rhythm we're gonna do the E flat minor nine chord but instead of going we're gonna go we're gonna we're gonna play the same picking that we did on the d flat major seven so get your E flat minor nine chord we're gonna go thumb fingers thumb fingers one two E minor nine thumb fingers thumb fingers then quickly switch to the a flat 13 and go fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers that was fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers so that was fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers so that was fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers put it together we've got bunka one two one more time then we're gonna go do what I like to call an F minor seven chord F minor seven is sort of a bar chord but it's not that bad you guys are gonna be fine with it don't worry put your pointer finger on the eighth fret of the second string from the top this microphone placement is poor because it puts all the Shadow on my face we're just gonna live with it for now pointer finger eighth fret second string from the top you do what you would like to borrow with that finger you'd like to take that finger and Smash down on all the strings I'll show you an alternative but this is what Lele does so we've got that put your middle finger on the ninth fret of the second string from the bottom put your ring finger on the 10th fret of the third string from the top people of the world friends and relatives this is an F minor nine chord no no it's a lies F minor seven chords because we don't have the nine look one two three four five six seven eight nine is that note in there no it's not it's just an F minor seven I was testing you on this chord you're gonna go you're gonna play the same picking You're Gonna Go thumb fingers thumb fingers one two play with me thumb fingers thumb fingers then we're gonna go to a B flat seven flat 13. B flat seven flat 13 is like this put your pointer finger sixth fret top string put your middle finger sixth fret third string from the top ring finger seventh fret third string from the bottom pinky eighth fret second string from the no this I'm making so many mistakes guess what this is this is a B flat 13 chord because look one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelvet thirteen we want a flat 13 so you take that note and you scooch it over so it's actually going to be six skip six seven seven right there with the pinky do you see that B flat seven flat 13 guys and we're gonna go uh fingers thumb fingers or something what are we doing we're going [Music] guys so that's thumb fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers one two three play with me and thumb fingers thumb finger switch fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers you do not have to play this Rhythm the stupid microphone is in a terrible place changed the headlight on a car today how long does that take takes what 20 minutes it guess how long it took me it took me six hours to do it I literally had to remove the bumper to the car shout out to my dad who was there with me the whole time to be perfectly honest he did about 98 of the work and I sat there and drank sparkling water but still still look at how dirty my hands are okay what are we doing what are we doing are we learning a song or was this car talk with Where's My Water we're almost done with the song I promise I know it doesn't seem like it but we are so we just finished our B flat seven flat 13 then we go we go back to E flat minor nine we're gonna do the same picking Rhythm we're doing a second here but instead of switching to the a flat 13 halfway through we're gonna do the whole Rhythm on the E flat minor nine so it's gonna go a little something like this one two three four thumb fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers fingers thumb fingers all on the E flat minor nine one two a little slower [Music] and then and only then do we switch to the a flat 13 chord and we're gonna go like this [Music] so that was thumb fingers thumb fingers fingers forward two three four five two three so like I said we're almost done then there's a little pause there's a little three beat a little break there what happens at this point is we repeat all of that again we play the whole a section all the way through so we go back to the E flat minor nine finish I'll play you know what I'll just play here let's let me I'm gonna play let me play through what we have so far you can play long you can listen it's up to you I'm gonna start from the intro one two three intro then the a section singing starts [Music] [Music] [Music] stay there [Music] Papa then you play that over again does that make sense let's see that was the a section I just played through the whole a section then I played like one and a half more chords of the a section so you do the a section twice guys then we go to the B section but the B section is basically just the a section this is when she sings about being a loon I'm pretty sure elune is a type of bird correct is there light on my nose oh there is look why didn't even tell me I had light on my nose so the B section goes like this look it's so you're gonna love it B section is like exactly the same like we go [Music] four five blocks [Music] so all of that was literally exactly the same as the a section it's lit just it's exactly the same but then at the very end after all of that we go E flat minor nine we're gonna go but then switch to the a flat 13 right away so and then we go back to the D flat major seven and we're gonna go no no no no no it goes [Music] I feel like my explanation of the B section was lacking let's play the B section together and I'll yell out the chords one two three four E flat minor nine a flat 13 then d flat major seven then back to E flat ah d flat okay so the problem apparently is that I can't play the rhythm and say the names of the chords at the same time so I think we're just screwed for the B section well that sucks so let me show you the ending the very very end after they played this is what they do they go the intro then they go a section a section B section then they repeat the a section a section B section again then they get to the outro the ending the tag ending tag ending goes like this it goes [Music] so here's what just happened I did the E flat minor nine going to the a flat 13 just like I've done a thousand times I went to the F minor seven chord up on the eighth fret you know that one phone but then when I got to the B flat seven flat 13 which was the six skip six seven seven I win that's my little so you have your fingers on the same notes but you just go you kind of like heal your hand off I'm going thumb point or middle ring just I'm gonna grab it onto all the strings I just I'm literally just like peeling my hand off like that and then we go back to the E flat minor nine you peel your hand off once again go to the a flat 13 peel your hand off and then finally nope oops that was bad d flat major seven peel your hand off peel your hand right off guys just peel it off I think I told you I was going to give you an alternative to the bar chord I'll show you that at the end now how about that this right here is an F minor nine as well seven F minor seven [Music] this is the high octave this is low octave so here's what it is pointer finger first front on the top string nothing on the next string then first fret first fret first fret and you just play top string third fourth fifth from the top F minor seven chord really really let this one fall apart far away through still don't think I ever really explained the B section but that's just you know what we do what we can with what is given to us in and at this time and at this time that's all that I was given [Music] um"
