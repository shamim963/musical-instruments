    "Transcript": "[Music] hey guys this is how to play Happy Birthday for beginner's guitar um I've arranged this to make it absolutely as easy as possible though you will see countless other variations of it if you look elsewhere on the internet but this one's very easy to do and it's perfect for you guys to play for your friend's birthday or a family vacation in front of people and it's also perfect for that because it's recognizable this is why it's going to be one of the First videos on my new channel for lead guitar lessons cuz it's a Melody that is very recognizable by everyone so if you want more of these lessons which are more tailored for lead guitar melodies that are very recognizable um you want to subscribe to this Channel and as I say most of them are going to be quite easy and then we'll be getting some more advanced ones as well um so hit that subscribe button and let's get you in for a closeup on how to play Happy [Music] Birthday [Music] okay so we start off we're going to be mainly playing this with our first finger seeing as this is a beginner's lesson so we're going to go the open third string which is this one third up from the bottom 1 2 3 and we play that note twice and then put our first finger at the second fret of that same string remember putting it this side of the Fret not this side to make it all sound better and then back to the open string so we have 1 2 3 4 that it one more time 1 2 3 4 and then we move down a string place our first finger at the first fret and play that note and then to the open B string and that's the first section and there's basically four of those sections so that as a recap one more [Music] time nice and slow that's on the third string and that's on the second string I'm using a pick or a petrum in this lesson and having the pick on the side of my first finger with the thumb on the top um and placing that here and resting the sort of palm of my hand or the the sort of lower part of my thumb um on the guitar itself and having all this part as having contact with the guitar should really help to [Music] stabilize and sort of navigate this right hand if you prefer you can use finger style and generally just use your first finger for this one you can use whichever other fingers feel comfortable with it but if you're using your thumb for everything it's it's better to start to use your fingers if this is a style of music that that you're interested in and essentially I'm using exactly the same technique with this part of my arm my forarm and my wrist resting on the guitar and that should really benefit you uh the next section starts off the [Music] same but the last two notes are slightly different we're going to use our middle finger uh third fret on the B string on the second string and then to our first finger first fret of the same string so those two notes the extra ones one and two so that is the whole first half of happy birthday so far just to recap nice and slow let's try and play it together in 1 2 3 4 and [Music] again now it's likely the rhythm of that that might be tricky for you or the the picking of the notes so piging hand has to be up against the guitar and and all the forarm has contact with the guitar you can pivot on your little finger as well but this is mainly stained to like the middle strings so you might find this technique of anchoring your pinky a little trickier I'd recommend you go for this other than that just try and think of the melody of the song da da da to you and try and play as as the melody sounds as you would sing it um so uh this is does have the we do have the tab available for this song is in the description below on a link to my website unless I get told to take it down which does happen occasionally um but if you can follow this this would be 0 0 2 0 on the tab so so every line of your tab is another line every line on your tab is another string on your guitar going horizontally and the numbers are the Fret numbers so 0 0 2 0 would be on the third string the third line from the top for example but let's move on we'll recap this a little bit later but let's just do the last section of this song So section three first of all open open again that's the third string so this one and then to the thinnest string and we can play that with your first St middle finger it doesn't really matter it's a big jump with your picking hand to the open E string da da da da and then um first finger first fret of the second string to that open string [Music] finally that's the third [Music] section that one more [Music] time and finally first finger first fret of the thinnest string to open so that one's played twice 1 2 [Music] 3 to First Finger first fret of the second [Music] string middle finger at the third fret of the same string and then to finish first finger well it's just come [Music] from and that's the whole thing uh just to recap that last bit one more time so that's from the third string to the first notice how the hand still anchors and moves from the wrist [Music] and that's how to play happy birthday check out the tab on the website down below while it's still there and um have a go it from the top uh we'll have a quick run through it now if you need but other than that I recommend you kind of get straight on and look at the tab really but one more time let's have a look at this so two 3 [Music] 4 you can use other fingers such as your third or your little finger for this one there's no real right or wrong it's just a beginner's sort of um recognizable Melody so that's how to play Happy Birthday for beginner's guitar make sure you subscribe if that's something that you enjoyed and there'll be loads more videos coming your way real soon and thanks for checking us out bye for [Music] now"
