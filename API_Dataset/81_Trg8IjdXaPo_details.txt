    "Transcript": "so I've got a super fun song Here by Leonard Skinner it's only a three Chord song okay the three chords are going to be using we have an A minor chord we have a c chord and we have a G chord now the great thing about the a minor in the C chord is you have a little pivot point so when you're going from a minor to C all you have to do is lift your third finger up into place okay so here's a minor third finger comes up one string and over fret now you might see you have to kind of adjust your fingers a little bit in the fretboard just to slide up because with this c chord remember you always want to try and get the third finger to the front of the front if you're playing your c chord and this third finger ends up to the back of the Fret sometimes gonna sound muted so for those of you suffering from a muted c chord you can always check your fret make sure it's in the front you can also use my easy two fingered c chord if you want to because then it's easy to just add the finger for the a minor and then remove it to go back to that easy c chord so up to you guys we're doing this at the beginner level so I'm not going to be doing the fancy intro with all the picking I do have a video Lesson on that I'll put it up here if you want to go check that out but that's really not for beginners I will show you a little intro you can play that is at the beginner level so let's start with that right now so the intro has all this really really intricate picking that we're not going to get into at the beginner level that's more like late beginner early intermediate because it is very very fast okay but I'm going to show you a quick little Baseline that you can play over the intro and then we'll talk about the strumming pattern we're going to use so this all takes place within these first three Frets let me play it for you first and then we'll go over it step by step foreign so that's pretty easy at the beginner level and I know you guys like these cool little licks and stuff that you can play that are pretty simple so what am I doing we're starting on the open a string and we're just hitting the open string and then coming right to the second fret on the a string with my first finger so I'm going to be using my first and second fingers here so we got open two and then we're walking up we call this a walk up second fret is going to hit the third fret on the a string so we've got open two three and it's okay so sing the melody I'm not gonna the the rhythm's a little bit intricate here if you can sing it you can play it and then we've got Baba bum we've got a walk down so we're gonna go three two on the a string and then third fret on the G string so we're walking up the notes are going up and then we're walking down the notes are going down okay one more time [Music] and then we have another walk up three on the top string two on the a string and then the open a string so it's just three little lines so we have the walk up the walk down and then the walk back up okay again [Music] foreign okay so just three little quick little lines that you can play over the intro you'll hear it because it really really sticks out this is really the Baseline it's not the guitar part but it's a really cool part and you'll hear it come in and out throughout the song so especially if you're at the beginner level it's just something fun to play but now let's talk about the strumming pattern we're going to use for the rest of the song so another thing that's great about this song that I love for beginners is the chord progression the order of the chords is the same for the entire song so the chord progression for this song is c g a minor a minor okay so we're gonna do one strumming pattern of c one strumming pattern of G and then we're going to do that strumming pattern twice on a minor and before I show you the strumming patterns just if you don't know me my name is Lauren Bateman and I help make the guitar makes sense I specialize in helping absolute beginners especially older adults in their 50s 60s and 70s and we play amazing songs like this one by Leonard Skinner so let's talk about the two options I'm gonna give you I'm going to give you one option that's a little bit easier and then one that's still beginner but kind of like the next step and it's the one I personally like to use for this song because it gets a little more space so just so we can figure this out let's start with the G chord okay Everyone likes a good G chord and we're gonna do one two three four and played one two three four M okay again okay and that's our timing now this song is fast that's the one downside it is a faster song So if I played over that chord progression it's going to sound like this [Music] so you can hear that it's a fast song what I like to do is I actually like to drop one of the down strums and I know for beginners this can sometimes be tricky because there's like this weird space but it flows really well let me show you it's gonna sound like this foreign sounding much more like the song and I like this because it's a fast song and and doing the other strumming pattern it sounds a little rushed just sounds like it's almost just a little bit too much so what am I doing I'm dropping the strum on the second beat so I'm going one two three four and one two three four and one two three four and one two three four and now I don't know if you guys are watching my strumming hand I'm still keeping time so even though I'm not strumming that to be I'm still technically I'm strumming it with my hand I'm just not hitting the strings let's go in for a close-up and I'll show you ready one two here we go [Music] do you see how my strumming hand is always doing this no matter what whether I'm strumming the guitar or not and that is the secret to kind of missing or skipping strums while you're playing so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through the first two verses and the chorus to play through for you guys so that you can play along with me and if I'm going too slow you can always use the settings Cog right over there to slow me down one two one well mama told me when I was young sit down beside me my oldest son and listen closely do what I say is and if you do this it'll help you some sunny day yeah [Music] I'll take your time don't live too fast the troubles will come they they will pass go find a woman you'll find love and don't forget son there's someone up above feel super man oh there's something [Music] I understand [Music] oh won't you do this you can [Music] such a great song and if you guys are looking for another easy Leonard Skinner song I actually have a very simplified version of Sweet Home Alabama right over there go check it out"
