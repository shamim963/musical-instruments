    "Transcript": "I was so frustrated when I was trying to learn how to play chords it felt like every song used different chords and sure there was some common ones but I wanted to learn how to play all the chords so I could become a complete musician and play any song I wanted it wasn't until I understood that there's only five different kinds of chords that my playing really changed in this video we're going to cover these five categories in order of difficulty so you can not only build a complete chord vocabulary but also so you have a defined learning progression that you can follow to improve your chord playing let's start at level one level one is all about open chords when you're first starting there are seven essential open chords you've got to master we're going to walk through them really quickly but if you want a more in-depth tutorial for how to play anything in this video check out the links in the description I want this video to mostly stay focused on giving you the order to learn stuff and explaining that order your first starter pack of chords on guitar should include E major E minor a major a minor G major C C major and D major so that's how you play them and I know it probably feels like I just threw seven random chords at you but there are two good reasons we learn these seven chords first out of anything the first reason is the surface level reason and that's that you learn seven chords that you didn't know before so if a song calls for a C major for example you can now play a C major chord the second and more important reason we learned these seven first is because of the shapes you put your hand in to play these chords the more you understand the more you're going to realize that all other chord shapes are based on these seven shapes and because literally every other chord is just a modification of these seven chords you've got to master these before you move on to level two bar chords let's open level two by explaining how bar chords and open chords from level one are different open chords are called that because they involve open strings so for any open chord there's going to be some unfreed open strings ringing out bar chords are not like that with bar chords every single note is Fred the way we accomplish that is by taking our first finger and making a bar at a certain fret like for example I'm on the fifth fret here I'll make a bar then I can add a chord shape on top of that to create a bar chord just like before we're going to fly through the chord shapes if you want a super granular tutorial that video will be linked and then we're going to explain how you can use these chords to expand your overall vocabulary so the first step to playing any bar chord is making a bar basically you to take your first finger and press down really hard on every string at one fret if I were to borrow the fifth fret right here it sound like this then you're going to add a chord shape on top we're going to start with the E string root major shape this is clearly a major chord and the root is on the E string now you have the E string root minor shape same thing it's just a minor chord then we can move to the a string root minor shape which is still a minor chord but now the Root's on the a string and then there's the a string root major shape major chord root on the a string so that's how you play them but how do you use bar chords to actually move yourself closer to being able to play all chords to answer that I have to explain why I've been referring to these as bar chord shapes instead of just bar chords the reason is because bar chord shapes unlike open chords are actually movable so if we take our E string root major shape for example like I just showed you this is an a major chord because the root here is an A but unlike open chords you know there's no open strings tying this shape to this position so we can move this around we can move this up in this case this would be a B major chord because now the lowest note the root is B we can move it all the way down here now the lowest note is f being F major chord the fact that all four of the bar chord shapes are movable in this exact same way unlocks a ton of new chords for us that weren't available as open chords G major was available as an open chord but what about G sharp there's no G sharp major open chord but we can play that as a bar chord if you really think about it you break it down the four bar chord shapes that we learn learned unlock 48 unique chords that you can play now you know there's 12 unique notes on each string we can play A minor chord and a major chord for each one of those notes you multiply that by two strings you have 48 new chords you can play so at this point you might be making the mistake of thinking that that's it I mean you can play major and minor chords that correspond to every single note but there's still a little bit more to go you still have to learn level three seventh chords this is the level where chord names start to look more like industrial part numbers than music seventh chords are a kind of bar chord they're a little bit more complex which is why they're next in the learning progression and they only have one important difference from all the other chords that we've played up until this point that difference is that seventh chords are made up of four notes whereas everything we've been playing so far is only made up of three notes which sounds confusing but it's really not basically to build any chord all you do is take the first third and fifth note of the corresponding scale and you play them all back to back and that makes a chord all a seventh chord does is make that the first third fifth and seventh note and then you get a really pretty sounding chord I know I sound like a broken record but if you want a deep explanation I got a video on it we're going to go over the shapes really quickly all right so just like bar chords there's four essential shapes and just like bar chords all these shapes are movable the E string root major 7th chord shape looks like this the E string root minor 7th chord shape looks like this the a string root major 7th shape looks like this and the a string root minor 7th shape looks like this luckily understanding how to use seventh chords is super simple anywhere you would have a regular chord you can just substitute in a seventh chord and it sounds a little prettier if I'm playing a song and it has a B major chord I can sub in a B major 7th chord it'll sound kind of nice kind of Jazzy same thing goes for minor chords you're smart you get it moving on level four is about partial chords now this level is really guitar playing puberty we're going to put some musical hair on your chin here the good news is that there's no new chord shapes in this level we're just going to change how you use them when I say this level is guitar puberty what I mean is that as you mature as a musician you're going to realize that even though you can play a full chord you shouldn't always do that you should sometimes opt to play just a few notes out of a chord or a partial chord the highest level of musicianship is not about you it's about the song it's about serving the song that you're playing if you're playing in the context of a band or a recording where there's other harmonic information going on then you probably just don't need to play a lot of the chord that you can what you'll find is a lot of times these chords that contain less information actually sound better this can even hold true when you're not in the context of a band to demonstrate this uh I'll play a simple Funk groov and be the first time around I'll play it with full chords [Music] listen now this time to really exaggerate it I'm just going to play the top two strings and nothing else Probably sounds a lot more funky probably does a better job of communicating the musical idea I'm trying to communicate now knowing which notes to leave out in which to include is a creative decision that's up to you but this creative decision can be informed by experience practice and understanding the parts of a chord so you know which notes are maybe more important in a certain context as a quick footnote to this level I just want to mention that learning the cage system can be a really useful tool when it comes to understanding which notes are important but with that said let's finish off this list with level five in this level we're going to learn the secret chord that David played to please the Lord that was a good one it's 11:22 p.m. on a Saturday night what am I doing level five is all about chord extensions and chord inversions but before we talk about that I want to refocus on our original goal which was to learn all the chords so far we've talked about open chords bar chords seventh chords and partial chords and if you focus on just this stuff you're going to build a really complete really usable chord vocabulary to spoil the ending here there's a theoretically infinite number of chord inversions and extensions that could do so there's a theoretically infinite number of chords you could possibly play but practically speaking again if you practice the stuff we've talked about you'll be a really complete musician but in the interest of not being totally lost if you ever run across inversions or extensions let's talk about them really quick inversions are really simple all it is is taking the notes of a chord we were talking about how it's the first third and fifth note the corresponding scale and just playing them in a different order so instead of 135 you could play like 315 for example I'm not going to fully explain the cage system in this video but it's a really good place to start when it comes to cord inversions to give a really quick example of chord inversions I could play D major like this I can invert it and play it like this like [Music] this there's a lot of different chord inversions chord extensions are just adding more notes to chords so if you think back to seventh chords adding the seventh to our regular Triads or what they're called that was actually a chord extension I'm not going to give you any cord shapes here because there's so many of them and there's so many different ways to do the same thing I don't want to confuse you just understand the most common chord extensions you're going to see are the 9th 11th and 13th and these are just the 2 fourth and sixth scale degrees respectively played an octave up and thrown into the chord if you're interested in extensions you should study Jazz so that brings us to the end of all the chords you should learn on guitar in order we talked about open chords bar chords seventh chords partial chords and we talked about how those are the chords you should work on if you're trying to build a complete vocabulary and then you should understand chord inversions and chord extensions because you can never know all of those but it is important to understand them I hope this helps you learning chords and thank you for watching"
