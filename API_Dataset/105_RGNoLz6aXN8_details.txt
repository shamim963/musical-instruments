    "Transcript": "hello I'm gonna teach you this today very simple two finger finger picking as a bonus if you got this we'll add this but this is good enough okay I'm doing this whole tutorial on a G chord so the way I play G chord is with my third finger my ring finger right here on the third fret of the low E and my pinky on the third fret of the high E string like this muting the a string I think that's the best way to play a g but for the whole first part until I tell you otherwise you only need your third finger on the low E string because we're not hitting the string for a while we're just doing this all right all right you know I'm playing a G chord so we're just going to focus on the right hand first thing I'm going to do is put my ring finger in my pinky right here on the guitar they're gonna stabilize because we're only doing a two finger picking pattern we're just using the thumb and the index finger alright so these guys are right here stabilizing and this thumb is going to start going from the G which is on the low E string to the open D just back and forth this is the basis of most finger picking patterns back and forth let's do this for a while because this is really your foundation and every stage of this [Music] finger picking learning finger picking is pretty meditative you can just hang out here this is step one so this is already a third of the entire thing [Music] I'd probably call it more like half or more [Music] Friday nights of loud outside thank you hearing Prospect Heights Brooklyn this is step one boom boom boom boom if it feels easy that's okay you can kind of look around maybe stop looking at your fingers if you were looking at your your fingers if you're looking at your hands stop looking at it look around see if it's still easy take a breath because really we want our body to be doing this we don't want to be concentrating because we're going to be concentrating on the music just letting the music come through and we want to be able to just hang out when we play music in my opinion so it's good to go past the phase when you're concentrating and get into the face where it's just your body doing it all right this is step one that's all it is you might miss the strings here and there just keep up the Rhythm that's the most important thing the count here is one two three four one two three four foreign I'm going to add the next element which is going to come from our index finger oops and it's going to come on the one two and one two and so it's going to come on the end of two one two and are you serious with the power alarm okay and it's going to hit our open G string here we go three four one two and one two and just plucking one two and one two and one two and one two and foreign G string stay here I'm gonna stay here if you really get impatient feel free to skip ahead but I think it's worth it it's not a long tutorial and it's worth it to really just get it in your bones and if it's moving too fast just go back hang out with this thumb thing for as long as you want before you add the index finger foreign I find it very relaxing this is better it's meditative it's calming me down okay you ready one two and three four one two and three four take a little rest the next thing we're going to add one two and three and four one two and three and four remember the thumb is taken care of one two three four so we're just adding two ands one two and three and four and it's this finger both times the first time is hitting the G string second time it's going to hit the B string so you can just practice that if you want G B [Music] B G [Music] B that's all we're adding to the thumb all right let's do it in rhythm here's a thumb we had this two and three four one two and three four ready one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four I'm gonna hang out here because this is actually it this is Travis pick right here there's different versions this is what I consider Travis pick I believe it was named after Merle Travis but he does a lot of different stuff [Music] two and three and four one two and three and four is it you have it if you got this [Music] one two and three and four one two and three and four two more times two and three and four one two and three and four all right take a little break um that's it that's Travis pick and if you don't believe me here it is fast it's more recognizable [Music] I mean that really that's what we're doing I should sped up one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and okay I hope you got that if that is tricky still if it's too fast what I'm doing or you want to go back just go back to the thumb and do that for as long as you want I mean if you spend a half an hour after this video getting this it is going to be so worth it you will play this picking pattern for the rest of your life and it's so relaxing to learn also so you can always go back here you can always go back here one two and three four and then you add the final one two and three and four one two and three and four all right okay if you're feeling decent about that or even if you're not but you just want to know this part let's add one more thing it's going to make it be like this we're just gonna do now you need your G chord now your full G chord however you play G and we are going to at the very beginning of our picking pattern we're gonna play with our thumb and index finger at the same time our two g notes that's the low E string the high E string which are both on a G right now third fret and you just basically squeeze your finger together like all right this foreign [Music] let's kind of get that for a second squeezing together like this whoops all right and the way this is gonna go that's just gonna be on the very first beat of the picking pattern so on the one instead of just the thumb like we were doing before we're doing both of these so it's gonna go like this one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four one two and three and four one foreign keep that Rhythm real steady one two and three and four almost exaggerated it's a big old space there and after the last one too here full B and full B one and four four one okay that's it you got it it sounds like this so you can practice it on G like we were doing it foreign the important thing is you need to know where the root is of the other chord so say you're on C you need to know that this is a c we're no longer hitting the sixth string which is the E string low E we're hitting the a string because that's where the root of the chord is C if you're on d a d chord you need to know that this is the root D so you're going like this it wouldn't make sense for a d chord to do this okay I hope you got something from that I really appreciate if you subscribe like it'll really help me a lot alright see you later"
