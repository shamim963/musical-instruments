    "Transcript": "all right this video has been long overdue here is my updated daily guitar practice routine all in all I practice for about four to five hours a day so it's really important to stretch beforehand I stretch for about 20 minutes a day so the first hour of practice for me is usually just practicing scales I turn on a metronome and just get lost in arpeggios to warm up after I'm all warmed up I take to YouTube to try and learn as much as possible today it was a Marcus King [Music] and after that I start practicing bends this has been a recent habit of mine I just want to get my bends nice and clean for the gigs so this is like the fourth hour I just kind of go ham and do whatever I feel like playing it just helps me relax it's like therapy and one of the last things I do is fire up my doll to start recording online videos like the one you're seeing right now"
