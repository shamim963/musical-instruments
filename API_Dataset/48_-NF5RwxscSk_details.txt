    "Transcript": "we're doing it sailor song by Gigi Perez the one and only one two oh I was on a did you see what happened there I was like here we go energy and then my pick went the thing about these pics that not many people know is if you just kind of give it a little squeeze it just vanishes into thin air 1 2 [Music] okay oh jeez little louises I don't know the Sailor song not the Sailor song Just sailor song by Gigi Perez my name is steuart Alexander Lem Brown I would like to tell you that this song is in standard tuning you need a capo on the fourth fret also this song is going to be exceedingly simple and it's going to be a joy and a pleasure and a blast and this video really should be under 5 minutes long if this video is longer than 5 minutes I give you my express permission to hunt me down and if I am eating anything you can slap it out of my hands I'm eating a bagel slap it out of my hands for perpetuity it could be 25 years from now and you see me eating a croissant and you just go remember when that video was over 5 minutes long slap it out of your hands do you think that you could play for me a C major 7 chord you got your cap on the fourth fret put your your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the top put your middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the top this is a cjor 7 chord it's time now for us to learn the strumming pattern on this C major 7 chord would you please strum down down up down up down one two here we go down down up down up down then you're going to strum down up down up down down up so it's down down up down up down down up down up down down up one two karate jump here we go down down up down up down down up down up down down up how'd you do one more time make it count down down up down up down down up down up down down up can you do it two times in a row let's see go down down up down up down down up down up down again down down up down up down down up down up down down up if you are this is going to seem embarrassing but it's not embarrassing everybody does it it's fine people of the world friends and relatives nobody's looking at you anyway they're all thinking about themselves that's the stupidest by the way that thing about when they your parents say no you there's no need to be self-conscious or embarrassed because no one's even looking at you they're all just thinking about themselves it's like that's not true I look at at other people and go look at that embarrassing thing that person's doing literally every day of my life every day at school in every one of my classes can you believe that guy's wearing that shirt what an idiot it's horrible but it's true so I just wanted to let you know the next time you're doing something on guitar and you're like oh man this sucks everybody thinks I suck like okay I'm not saying you suck but if you suck other people are thinking about it they're going I'm better at Guitar than that guy this is okay I shouldn't have said this um uh so here's the potentially embarrassing thing you can do to practice it's not embarrassing at all you can drum the rhythm of the strumming before you strum it so if you're trying to get the Rhythm in your head and in your heart and in your hands and you're trying to go down down up down up wait okay wait what what was it go like this go do it with me here we go here we go one more time guys now your hand knows what it feels like to play that Rhythm and it might be easier to strum it one two here we go down down up down up down down up down up down down up oh crap I just realized this video is going to be way longer than 5 minutes so you do that strumming pattern twice on the C major 7 then we switch to an E minor chord just lift up your ring finger finger and put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top keep your middle finger on that second fret of the third string from the top so you just go from this to this do the strumming pattern twice on this C major 7 do the strumming pattern twice on this E minor let's try it one two here we go down down up down up down down up down up down down up down down up down up down down up down up down switch down down up down up down down up down up down down up down down up down up down down up down up down down up guys you do that twice and then you've completed the introduction to the song now if you would like to add a little bit of pizzazz to the intro I do believe that something on the actual recording is doing this there's a little hammer on that happens check it out on the C major 7 instead of just going down down down up down up down you can go like this so you do the first strum without your middle finger and then you immediately hammer on to complete the chord with your middle finger and then finish the strumming so it's hammer down up down up down down up down up and you can do a hammer again right at the end if you want you can go hammer down up down up down down up down up hammer down up and then do it again let's try it with the hammer on this is optional hammer down up down up down down up down up hammer down up hammer down up down up down down up down up hammer down [Music] up did you see what I did there I did the same hammer on thing with the E minor but I hammered on with my pointer finger instead of with my middle finger pretty cool right so those are some optional things you can do if you would like to add Pizzazz I am sick of playing the intro let's move on to the verse the verse goes like this one two listen here down down up down up down down up down up down down up oh down up down up down [Music] bow F same strumming pattern did you notice it's the exact same strumming pattern for the entire rest of the song we do the strumming pattern once on the C major 7 without any hammer on just the regular strumming pattern once then go to the E minor and do the regular strumming pattern one single solitary time Uno times that's Spanish for one I'm surprised you didn't know that then you switch to a G chord lift up your middle finger keep your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top put your middle finger on the third fret of the top string then take your pinky and your ring finger and put them on the third Frets of the bottom two strings do the strumming pattern twice on this chord so it was once on the C major 7 once on the E and twice on the G I kind of like how we get to keep one finger in the same place for each chord switch it's like first your middle finger is the like uh bridge between the two chords and then your pointer finger gets to be the bridge but then when you go from the G to the C oh then you lose your Bridge okay never mind well it was nice while it lasted guys let's play the verse all the way through one two a little faster down down up down up down down up down up down down up e down up down up down down up down down up G down up down up down down up down up down down up hey Mony Mony B buy buy start it over [Music] oh now here's what's great we're done with the song we've learned the entire song listen to this for the intro you do the C major 7 twice E minor twice and you that whole thing twice that's the intro then for the verse we do what we just did C major 7 E minor G we do that Quattro times in a row Spanish for four surpris you didn't know that then we go to the chorus the chorus is that exact same chord progression another four times just going C major 7 E minor G twice for the chorus you're going to do it three times loudly and then one time very quietly as quietly as you can great then we go to the second verse exactly the same as the first verse you just do that chord progression four times then we go to the second chorus literally exactly the same as the first chorus you do the chord progression three times loudly one time quietly then you get to the ending of the song and you just play those same chords two times through quietly and then you're done that's it my name is Stuart Alexander Layman Brown I hope you do en I I think that I I would like you to play the song uh upload a video show me your progress I don't know what that means I've never said that before I mean if you upload a video I'll watch it but it's not like a homework assignment I don't know [Music]"
