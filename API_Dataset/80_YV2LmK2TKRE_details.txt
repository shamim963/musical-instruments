    "Transcript": "foreign [Music] this is going to be me teaching you how to play lover you should have come over by Jeff Buckley really bad feeling about this one I just just a really bad feeling about its standard tuning on a standard guitar with no capo we start with a d a d chord is as follows middle finger second fret on the bottom string ring finger third fret on the second string from the bottom then your pointer finger plays the second fret on the third string from the bottom what I've very strongly recommend I'm going to insist that your thumb just comes up over the back of the neck and touches the top string to mute that top string there's some fancy stuff we're gonna do with the middle finger but first thing we gotta do is we just gotta get this basic strumming going on are you ready for this basic strumming goes like this [Music] so here's here's how you do this basic strumming I keep telling you about you've got your D chord you're going to strum down up up up down that's the first part let's just do that together it's down up up up down karate job down up up up down here we go down up up up down one more time down up up up down so good so good in fact that I'm gonna add some more strums on top of that down up up up down up down up so that we added an extra up down up did you notice when I said that let's do that whole thing just one one single solitary time then we're gonna stop one two three here we go down up up up down up down up oh so good one more time a little slower one two three watch my blee oh I really thought I was gonna come up with something other than bleed to say at the end of that count off what we have to do is we have to play this basic strumming pattern but instead of just doing it one isolated time we're gonna play it four times in a row I know you're sick of the strumming pattern already one two three here we go down up up up down up down up down up up up up down up down up down up up up to throw off my rhythm down up up up down up down up so good oh man we gotta add in some fancy middle finger stuff now I warned you about it a minute ago okay so here's how you're gonna do this you're gonna start off without your middle finger so the bottom string is just going to be open and on your first strum down no middle finger great but then immediately for that first strum up you're just gonna smash your middle finger right back down onto the second fret of the bottom string so we've got down up did you see what happened so we've got down on the open string up with the middle finger up again with the middle finger then you get rid of the middle finger and strum up with it open and then you strum down with it open so we've got down up up open down open down open that's confusing this I have my my Pokemon tuner honestly it's not that good I do not endorse that tuner sorry I'm sorry it's not nothing against Pikachu the tuner just kind of sucks one two three what am i counting off [Music] that the thing we just played immediately after you do that strum down without the middle finger you're just gonna do a quick hammer on with your middle finger so you just smash it right back down onto the second fret of the bottom string you don't strum it in additional time you just smash it down so now we've got down up up the hammer on and we actually went a little bit faster it's a it's a what I like to call a quick hammer on you barely even hear it I keep pointing at it I'm doing a lot of pointing today let's do this let's do it slowly together but I want to warn you it's kind of hard to do slowly but we have to do it slowly just to hear where everything goes one two three here we go down up up up down hammer on down up up one more time fantastic you can go ahead and leave your middle finger there and strum our final up down up let's do it two times in a row one two three here we see oh that was so good now we have to add in our little um little thing that we're doing so we're going so you play it once totally normal just like we just did the second time through we started exactly the same we go we do our little hammer on but then we're gonna strum what do we do I know exactly what we do I really should have planned this out before I decided to start teaching it [Music] go ahead and pull off your pointer finger and your middle finger you can take those off but keep your ring finger in the same spot you're gonna strum down right on that cord then we're gonna go to this guy right here this is a c add nine chord so this is top string you want it muted by your thumb middle fingers playing the third fret on the second string from the top pointer fingers playing second fret on the third string from the top ring fingers on the third fret of the second string from the bottom it never left that spot and then pinky plays the third fret on the bottom string you're gonna strum up on that chord so that goes I ate a lot of oatmeal and my throat and my stomach is going like bro give us a second to handle this oatmeal before you start talking you're gonna strum up on this c add9 chord then you're gonna strum up on the open strings it's like a little transition and then we strum down on an E minor E minor is top string open middle finger second fret on the second string from the top ring finger second fret third string for the top the rest is open that's a lot of stuff we just went through watch this now that we've talked through it let me show you let me show you how this goes we've got up down a bunk it finger point I don't know where I lifted my fingers off then I strummed up on the seat nine then I'm strumming up on the open strings down on the E minor let me do it again nice and slow [Music] oh it's quite pretty once you um practice it why do I always feel the need to say oh it's good it'll be good when you practice it no kidding let's practice going from the D through all that stuff to the E minor let's do that once very slowly then I'll show you what's next one two three three slow [Music] it was great right you mastered it it was like you're like I didn't I didn't even need to practice it because I'm so good at it already I'm really proud of you it's good why don't you brag about it some more on the E minor we're gonna go like this down down up down up down down up down up down down up down up down so that was down down up down up four times now I have to tell you something about this E minor chord Jeff Buckley when he played this song he would add in some fancy stuff during this E minor chord sometimes but not all the time so the thing that he would do pretty regularly is when he first got to the E minor he'd have his pinky down on the second fret of the bottom string making it into an E minor at nine chord and he'd go down down beautiful chord then you get rid of his pinky making it to a normal E minor down down then with his pinky he'd play the third fret on the second to bottom string making it into an E minor seven chord down down up down up and then he would get rid of his pinky making it into a normal E minor chord again here's what I am going to suggest to you you have three options I know there's too many options I should only give you one or at most two but I'm giving you three because I am a fool on this day there's no option number one keep it keep it simple stupid just play E minor regular E minor the whole time just go E minor D Minor etc etc and so on and so forth option number two is that thing I just showed you with the pinky open yeah that thing third fret open um just do that every time it sounds nice it works just do it every time it'll add a little extra Pizzazz to your playing option three any one of those chords pinky on the second front on the bottom open strings pinky on the third fret from the second string of the bottom uh just throw any of those in whenever you feel like it on the E minor it's gonna sound great this get loosens things up a little bit more and it can be a terrifying overwhelming experience but don't worry there are counselors standing by to help you through your E minor situation I'm gonna recommend here's my recommendation do this do that every time I distinctly decided I was gonna be quicker today and I just spent how many minutes talking about me talking about giving you multiple options guys I'm wearing makeup today where is it oh I did a good job wait it's right here it's right here I had a little the thing and I put a little makeup there but then how black my fingers I told you I had a bad feeling about this uh we're learning this is the verse to the song by the way we're learning the verse to the song and we're we're a decent way through it let's just play what we just did so far so we had the whole deed thing with stuff and things one two three here we go oh here we go right back right back into it so good here's what happens we're gonna call we're gonna call that the main riff the main riff is that whole D with the strumming and the thing going to E minor that's the main riff so we do the main riff once without any singing nothing happening we just do the main riff great then we get into the first verse and we play that main riff while he's singing the question is how many times I'm gonna say two let's say we do it two times that's probably accurate then we go into what I'm going to call the pre-chorus or the second half of the verse it's up to you I don't know I wasn't there when he named the parts of the songs we're gonna call this part the verse I'm gonna call this the pre-chorus done there I decided [Music] I always mess up that part okay well check it out second fret second string from the top then third fret second string for the top then fourth fret second string for the top I recommend having your ring finger when you get to the fourth fret so it goes two three four I'm just going pointer middle ring two three four then your pointer finger keep your ring finger there on the fourth fret but your pointer finger is gonna play the second fret on the third string from the top the rest is just gonna be open you're gonna go like this you're gonna pluck second string from the top then the third string for the top and the fourth string for the top then the second string to the bottom so that was just [Music] two three four Bing Bong bang and then you get a little break then we have to go to this chord so this one pointer finger second fret on the top string skip the a string the second string middle finger goes to the second fret on the third string from the top ring finger plays the third fret on the third string from the bottom and Pinky plays the third fret on the second to bottom string another option instead of using your pulling your finger you can use your thumb but as we've discussed I'm already giving you too many options shame on me boom boom boom wow oh yeah so that was oh oh hey and then we have to play a couple more chords guys we're gonna go to a g but it's not gonna be any ordinary normal G this is the G chord do you know g g viewer have you met so the G chord um let me show you what he does play pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top mute the top string with your thumb then with your ring finger play the third fret on the second to bottom string so we're only using two fingers thumb muting the top string you're gonna play this is like a g but it's a weird G it's like a g over B okay that would then there now you know it for the test uh this is okay here's the hard part so he strums that then he immediately switches to a d and he goes like this okay Swiss drums down on the regular D then he adds his pinky to the third fret of the bottom string strums up and then he goes back to normal D and strums down but here's the kind of weird thing about this D you have to make sure that you really hit the open a string a lot of the time with a d chord we want to mute the a string but we want to make sure that we really hear that second string from the top so it goes foreign [Applause] not too bad right then we go to a full-on normal G which is middle finger third fret on the top string pointer finger second fret on the second string from the top then open string open string ring finger and Pinky on the third fret of the bottom two strings I don't like this part of the song I think it's hard to play it goes oh and when we get to that g we're gonna go one two three four pound pow so it goes like down down up down down I'm very upset I'm very mad this is that oatmeal I was talking about kind of want to take a bite of it right now but that would be a rude thing to do on camera immediately after pow pow and the G chord we go right back to our main riff again uh that's not how it goes oh we just played the entire verse it was a little it was a little rough it was tough it was rough and tumble is what I would say um should we play the entire verse all the way through once I really don't want to you don't want to let's do it one two three and Ty or verse the guitar is going out of tune and we repeat that Out Of Tune guys too bad it's impossible for a tune it watch this [Music] oh I hate it [Music] great we played the whole verse fantastic I'm so excited for you then he plays the whole verse again we're gonna call that verse two anyway I have to tune my guitar I used the opportunity to also eat some oatmeal time to learn the chorus before the chorus has the second time through the verse remember our pow pow part of the verse so right before the chorus instead of playing the pow pow he goes to an F sharp F sharp is as follows there are a few ways you can do it I'm gonna show you um them the most standard way to play F sharp pointer finger first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth I got stuck in accounting thing should I start the whole thing over put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the bottom put your middle finger on the third fret of the third string from the bottom put your pinky on the fourth fret of the third string from the top put your ring finger on the fourth fret of the second string from the top then take your thumb and just you can either play the second fret on the top string with your thumb or if that is uncomfortable for you you can just mute the top string there's our F sharp chord if the bottom string is open It's actually an F sharp seven whatever I said there were multiple options I'm only showing you this one I'm pretty sure this is how Jeff Buckley plays it it's how I want to play it it's an F sharp chord okay so that means we go [Music] [Applause] great F sharp it's just he plays it like one two three like three beats right before the chorus great we're it's settled we did it and then it's time for the chorus chorus goes like this I guess I'm gonna play the whole thing foreign [Music] yes it's a bar chord there are bar chords in the song it's true pointer finger plays the second fret on the second string from the top ring finger plays the fourth fret on the third string from the top pinky plays fourth fret third string from the bottom middle finger third fret on the second string from the bottom if you can have your pointer finger smash down on the second fret of the bottom five strings like that we'd love it if it was muting that top string B minor chord you're gonna strum down down up down okay then get rid of your pinky and strum down down up down we just changed it from a B minor to a B minor seven doesn't make any big huge difference to the chord it just it just adds an extra quality great then you go to an E minor that's not a bar chord you can handle that you go down down up down then put your pinky on the third fret of the second string from the bottom also makes that into an E minor seven chord not a big deal you don't even have to do it if you don't want but I think it sounds good and I'm pretty sure that's what he does so we've got B minor E minor seven E minor down down up down down down up down down down up down down down up down one more time he does it three times then after the third time we go to a c chord I haven't showed you a c in this video yet ring finger third fret on the second string from the top middle finger second fret third string from the top the G string third string for the bottom is open then pointer finger plays the first fret on the second string for the bottom on this here is said unto thine c chord you're gonna strum down down up down up down down up down up down down that was four times going down down up down up I think [Applause] yeah I'm right then you go to E minor okay we're now this so that was what I call the chorus I don't know if that's what Jim Jim Buckley Jeff Buckley look at all this Shadow I need to change where my lights are this is atrocious it's egregious uh we're going into what I like to call the bridge we're going into the bridge bridge goes like this we're on our E minor we go E minor he plays the second fret on the bottom string we did that before we go E minor second fret to the open open strings regular yeah that's right then we're gonna go like this you ready for this what a disgusting chord thumb plays the first fret on the top string middle finger plays the first fret on the second on the bottom string second to bottom is open pointer finger plays the first fret on the third string from the bottom [Music] your thumb you're playing that first fret it would be grand if you could also have it mute the a string the second string from the top this right here that's right it's an F diminished chord how do you feel about it you also call it a d diminished chord you call it you could call it anything you want you guys so we're gonna strum down down up down on this guy and then what's great is right after that we get to the actual start of the bridge which I think is the most fun part to play of the song take all three of those fingers if you count your thumb as a finger and just slide them each up one fret and then add your middle finger to the third fret of the second string from the bottom this is a d over F sharp so we did [Music] you see that boom pocket here you are on this chord once you get to this chord we're gonna go like this we're gonna go down up down up so we're playing down just on the top string if you can stand it and then up on like the bottom three or four strings so we got ping pong ping pong you're gonna do that again ping pong ping pong fantastic job then you're gonna go up to this chord this is a G minor six chord middle finger plays the third fret on the top string you're just gonna mute the a string second string from the top with your middle finger the D string is open your ring finger plays the third fret on the third string from the bottom and Pinky plays third fret on the second string from the bottom down up down up down up down up my glasses just got almost knocked off I'm cutting off the top of my head with the screen quite a bit aren't I I think we're just gonna have to live with it down up down up down up then you're gonna slide up to the fifth fret but we have to make keep making but we have to make a couple other changes as well so middle fingers on the fifth fret of the top string your pointer finger you actually want it playing the fourth fret on the third string from the top and your pinky is gonna play the sixth fret on the third string from the bottom now this is the really crucial part we really want those bottom two strings to be open and we're gonna jump down up down up that's a pretty chord right so good all right then you're gonna slide your middle finger up to the seventh fret you're gonna have your pointer finger how do you oh wait what am I what am I doing I changed my mind completely ring finger is gonna play seventh fret on the top string pointer fingers gonna play fifth fret on the third string from the top and then Pinky plays seventh fret on the third string from the bottom so that's from the top we've got seven with the ring finger a string we'd like to have it muted pointer finger on five of the D string pinky on seven of the G string bottom two strings open why okay great take this exact same crazy chord and move it one two Frets up so now your ring fingers on the ninth fret pulling your fingers on seven pinkies on nine down up down up let's go through what we have so far for the bridge here guys should we shall we we go E minor Pinky crazy diminished [Music] how G minor six up to the crazy a chords on the fifth fret then up to the seventh fret Slide the two Frets over to the ninth fret [Music] great now take this exact same shape slide it up to the 12th fret so now it's ring fingers on twelve pointer is on ten of the third string from the top pinky is on 12 of the third string from the bottom you're just gonna strum this chord down once that was a that's a beautiful one fantastic then for this guy so here's what I did there played that one you're gonna slide your hand one fret backwards so now ring fingers on 11 pointers on nine Pinky's on eleven but get rid of your ring finger and instead have your middle finger play the 10th fret middle finger I play the tenth fret middle finger plays the tenth fret strum that one so we go pow backwards switch to middle finger then you go to the ninth fret the same one we did on the ninth fret before it was nine seven nine and we go and then really quickly you switch to the seventh fret one and then really quickly you switch to the fifth fret crazy chord and then really quickly you switch to the D over F sharp remember that one so that last part we just did I know there's a ton of stuff we went wait wait like this we have ping no no no no no no no no no no pay attention we go [Music] do that one more time one two three from the Twelfth fret one two three one two three fast fast fast and then finally you're gonna strum that was down on the D over F sharp and then up on E minor and we're gonna strum down down up down up down down then you strum the D chord then you go like this so that was just down up down on the D but I added my pinky for the up who doggies I think we made it through the bridge let's play the whole Bridge so starting from the E minor one you do the B minor it's a e minor part no one's watching E minor Pinky [Music] I messed up kinda I got it oh we're good oh hey who fast fast fast [Music] and then we're back into the verse back in that main riff guess what here's the whole verse again once maybe two times then guess what here's the whole chorus then he does that whole Bridge part again yeah there's a lead guitar that comes in and plays a cool riff during the bridge a second time through I'm not going to show it to you then I think he probably plays that multiple times then he probably goes back into them [Music] and then the song probably ends and we're just gonna I just I just honestly I'm being honest went a little bit better than I thought it would I didn't think I was going to talk about wearing makeup but it happened [Music]"
