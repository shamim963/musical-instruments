    "Transcript": "[Music] thank you [Music] why why the w what why k w i m by Yacht Club it's very difficult for me to say it's I I am pretty certain it's you know what I mean but I'm it might mean something totally different I don't know but I cannot for the life of me keep track of the name of this song Why k w i Am why quim right am I right [Music] um this gun's this one's gonna be short and sweet which knowing me I mean it's gonna be like 19 minutes long I have to discuss this is in standard tuning standard eadgbe tuning I just played it with the Capo on four on the recording and the studio album version that's what it sounds like it sounds like it's up there but and when they play it live no capo no capo they just go they just play it lower I think it's like sped up right like the pitch is bumped up in the recording that's what it sounds like to me so I think that when they perform it they just do it down here and he sings it down here and then when they did the album version they like you know put effects on it and sped it up a little bit and raise the pitch and so it sounds like it's on the fourth fret we're just gonna learn it the way that they do it live the way that I I think is how they originally performed it which is no capo that was my very long-winded way of saying no capo hi my name's Stuart welcome to guitar lessons with Stuart if uh I have said a few this I haven't said anything yet so why this is not useful good time good time to tell people to subscribe well did I wait did I tell people to subscribe like And subscribe if hey if you found this content useful go ahead and go ahead and like And subscribe I know that all of you out there are like I cannot believe how useful this information has been so far standard tuning record you guys know em Ma you put your middle finger tops first of all the top string is open I should say that right off the bat middle finger is going to play the second fret on the a string the second string from the top uh then your ring finger that's the one with the ring on it is gonna play the second fret on the D string which is the third string from the top now on a normal E minor chord all of those bottom strings would be open you're not going to push them at all but for this song Why k forget it for on this song by Yacht Club you're gonna have the E minor then your pinky is gonna push on the second fret of the high E string the bottom string of the guitar and then you're gonna give that a big old College strum that's our chord it's like an E minor with a nine on it it's a cool chord we don't care what it's called though it's just E minor with the pinky strum that how is it does it sound like the song again how's it going how you guys doing today I didn't ask you guys how you doing well it's great uh uh then what you're gonna do is you're gonna get rid of your pinky and you're gonna play that bottom string the high E string all by its Lonesome self so we've got strum bottom string just like that it's as easy as pry at this point oh oh oh I should mention I like to strum down on the E minor then what I like to do is strum up or pluck up on that bottom string you don't have to but it's pretty it's gotten then you're gonna play the second string From The Bottom the B string open so so no fingers pushing there so we've got blank at this point in time after you've played that open B string your pinky is gonna play the third fret on the B string the second string from the bottom you're just gonna play that note by itself so now we've got strum with the pinky bottom string open second string from the bottom open and then second string from the bottom on the third fret one two three four those are the first four beats the rhythm is pretty simple for this song it's just a bunch of quarter notes just bing bang bang bang so if you are bad at playing complicated rhythms this song is going to be great for you let's play play it with me we're gonna do it nice and slow it's Pinky open open B string third fret on the B string one two three here we go one two three one do it again one two three buckle my blee [Music] at this point in time you're gonna play the bottom string open again now what happens what happens after that guys and then you're gonna play the the the the the second string from the bottom open so we've got [Music] one two three four five six that's six beats right there we've got pinky bottom string open second string open third fret on the second string bottom string open second string from the bottom open let's play it just play all six of those things with me one two three here we go one two three third fret open open one more time here we go one two three four five six notice I'm keeping the E minor shape here the whole flipping time because right now we're gonna start that over again your pinky is going to go right back down to the second fret on the bottom string and you're gonna strum the whole kit in kabuk kitten caboodle kit is it like kit and caboodle or is it kitten caboodle I dare you have a cat and when it's a kitten name it caboodle a double dog dare you ironic that it's a cat thing and then I said dog dare one two three one two three is it too bright in here are these lights too bright I feel like I'm blind one two three hero we go [Music] see that and then we're just gonna start it over so we go bling bling playing but then okay here's the catch so we play those Six Beats all in a row then we start them over but when we get to the one two three four when we get to the fourth beat which was that third fret on the B string instead of keeping going we're gonna go like this we're gonna strum the chord with that pinky on the third fret of the B string but then we're gonna cut it short so we're gonna strum and then immediately after strumming you're just gonna put the strings you're gonna like do a little mini little karate chop onto the strings and just make that strum as short as you possibly can it's a little percussive thing so it's like [Music] see that right there that was okay I might give myself four out of six stars for that one this isn't a super big deal if you're not getting a little karate chop thing it's fine you can just do a regular strum and you know what everyone's still gonna love you unless they didn't love you to begin with and then this probably won't change anything about that we're we're about halfway through can we handle can we handle it I think we can handle it let's play this first half together one more time one two three here we go one two three one two three one two three short great at this point here's what's going to happen we're gonna merge two guitar parts together because there's like we're learning this is the primary guitar part that the lead singer guy plays and it sounds good and when we just like you know recordings of him playing it on his own and he just does this part here but then the bass player does an additional little thing and then on this album version there's an extra guitar playing an extra little thing that I want to go ahead and add it in because I think it sounds good and we can fit it in so right after we do that short strum you're gonna go like this on the a string the second string from the top play two one so that was second fret on the second string from the top first fret on the second string from the Top If you really want to get fancy you can Palm mute it that's when you take this part of your hand just that side of your palm you very lightly touch the strings you don't like push you just touch over here right by the bridge right here and then you get this nice little a little muted sound two one so we've got like short see that okay then we're gonna strum an A minor chord guys you might know an A minor chord you might not let's play it a minor chord is as follows top string we're not going to use you can mute it with your thumb or you can just make sure not to play it with your pick the a string the second string from the top is going to be open middle finger plays the second fret on the third string from the top the D string ring finger place the second fret on the G string which is the third string from the bottom and then your pointer finger plays the first fret on the B string the second string for the bottom That's a classic a minor chord but for this song by yacht club which is called y k w i m question mark your pinky is also going to play the second fret on the bottom string to be perfectly honest and I feel like we could be honest with each other we have that type of honest relationship um here's an example of me being honest about something um I cheated on my final project in Psychology in 12th grade and just total plagiarism stole my paper right out of the encyclopedia so I see we're being honest so now you know that you can trust me we've got this a minor uh wait was I gonna what was I gonna be honest about we talked about the psychology paper oh this is this is what I wanted to be honest with you about what we're gonna do right now is we're gonna do the exact same pattern we just did on the E minor chord but we're gonna do it while holding down on an A minor chord so it's gonna go like this [Music] similar but I'm just holding down a different chord we're still going to walk through it really quickly but that's just a little sneak peek so you've got the a minor chord with your pinky on the second fret of the bottom string give it a bill strum okay great get rid of your pinky play the bottom string open so is then you're gonna play the second string from the bottom but keep your pointer finger here your pointer finger just lives here now this is its new home you're gonna play the B string like that it's on the first fret so we got then with your pinky go to the third fret on the B string the second string from the bottom play that note then play the bottom string open and then play the B string again keeping your pointer finger here here's what we just did so that was a minor with the pinky bottom string open B string second string from the bottom third fret on the B string open bottom string first fret on the B string I think that I think that was perfectly clear then that's our six note pattern one two three four five six we start those six notes over again one two three but then when we get to that pinky note on beat four we're once again gonna do that short strum so it's one two three four five six one two three short how we doing um we we literally have two more notes left in this song So before we add in those last two notes I say we play it from the beginning very slowly so you can see how it all fits together back to the E minor with the pinky one two three here we go short [Music] you see what I did there sure so that little two one thing we talked about later is just leading us into the a minor chord two one a minor with the pinky more honesty if if we are being honest I think getting from the boom boom into the a minor with the pinky hardest part of the song hardest part of the whole flipping song it's just but you know what if you practice then you can get it whoa I just see what happened that's what happens every every video I'm like and then you do this and then you do this and then I just about when I know I'm approaching the end I just go like okay all right I'm done I'm done I'm done that's what I've got my broccolini not gonna eat it on camera but just to show you what I'm eating I also have there's a buffalo sauce it's bright orange I might dip my broccolini into the buffalo sauce not made with real Buffalo however uh I said something about having two notes left the last two notes we're gonna go like this the D string the third string from the top You're Gonna Play open and then first fret on the D string we're gonna Palm mute those just like we did with the two one we're gonna play open one and what those notes are doing they're just leading us back to the beginning so if we play it all the way through watch this we've got E minor short [Music] open one E minor I mean then I messed up at the end there and then if you want to sound like the recording on the album you put the Capo on four [Music] oh but yeah why why k w i m you know what I mean by Yacht Club my name's Stuart so mad at the end of this video God"
