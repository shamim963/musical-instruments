    "Transcript": "foreign [Music] Frank Ocean oh yeah oh yeah [Music] this is the hit song by Frank Ferrari called White ocean guys my name is Stuart welcome to the YouTube channel of Marin Music Center standard tuning no capo no bar Chords it's this this whole thing is going to be a breeze through the park you guys at the beginning there's just keyboard but I'm going to show you how to play the keyboard part on the guitar three chords first one is a sea tour guys now see Jordan you don't even play the top string at all put your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the top put your middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the top don't put anything on the G string the third from the bottom put your pointer finger on the first fret of the second string from the bottom what I would do if I were you if I were in your shoes what I would do is put your thumb and just like touch the top string with your thumb just to mute it speaking of being in your shoes would it be a wise idea for me to buy Crocs I've gone many years of my life without buying Crocs but I think the time may have come also what color should I get and how many gibbets should I buy I need your guidance on this guys I'll give you guitar guidance you give me Crocs guidance c chord just gonna strum it once you can't do it like four fast or too slow what is too slow what do I mean by that I mean like you can either go one two three four or you can go one it's up to you same difference two of one half a dozen of the other then we go to an E minor chord top string is open second fret second string for the top second fret third string from the top the rest of the strings are open it's just this it's easy do the same thing you know one two and then we go to a chord that sounds complicated but it's not complicated I'm gonna go ahead and call this chord and F major seven sus two it's a little bit of a weird name I'm not sure that's the greatest name for it but it's what I'm gonna go with ring finger third fret third string from the top don't push on the third finger string from the bottom at all put your pointer finger on the first fret of the second string from the bottom and then the bottom string you want open now there are a couple little um contingencies or difficulties about this one oh gotta turn the brightness down on my computer there we go um one is we definitely do not want to play the top string so you wanna make sure your thumbs up here meeting the top string if you have a big thumb and I know some of you out there have big thumbs trust me uh what just trust me you have big thumbs uh you can also like mute the a string the second string from the top so that's what I kind of do I kind of come over here go like that and then the top string muted a string muted if the a string the second string of the top is not muted that one's okay um okay uh the other thing that I need to tell you about with this chord is we would really love it if the bottom string the skinniest string if we could hear that open string a lot of the way what's gonna happen is as you're playing this chord your pointer fingers almost it's going to want to lean down and touch that bottom string and mute it if you can try to use the tipiest tip of your finger like that so that way see if I go like this gets muted but if I angle it up like that oh there we go okay well those are three chords we just did we did the C chord we did the E minor and then we did our F major seven sus2 uh the the F major seven says two we're gonna hold that one out twice as long so you can either count to eight fast or you can get to four slow let me show you what I mean we're gonna play through this whole intro one two two three four and a one two one two and a one two three four or one two three four one two four one two three four five six seven eight oh guys play it with me this is the F chord fiddly D here we go and C then e then F major seven sus two chord he does that so times upwards I've I I truly tried to count how many times he did it and 100 of the time I got distracted and lost count I'm gonna say it's more than five times and less than a hundred times he does this from the very beginning up until he says the word uh he says so many times wait no that's oh my God I wrote here so many times and then I because he does it so many times and then I was thinking those are the lyrics that he sings it's not true hi my name's Stuart subscribe to the channel because this has been such a good time so far he plays these cards so many times until he sings eventually yes he sings eventually eventually eventually yes he actually shows that twice eventually eventually eventually yes he does that the whole time then he's gonna sing I care for you when he sings I care for you that is when we go to this next section of the song the next section of the song oh I love this part you're gonna love it too it goes like this this is something that's gonna happen many more times in the song So mentally and physically and emotionally prepare yourself put your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the top put your middle finger on the third second fret of the third string from the top see that I just see held a bunch of numbers there you go so you've got really what this is is a c chord so you can go ahead and put your pointer finger on the first fret of the second string from the bottom as well classic c chord but we're only gonna play the second string from the top and the third string from the top so I've just got my pick and I'm just going you can pinch them together if you want to but listening to the recording I think he's strumming using a bit I don't know if he played guitar on this or not I know I've heard rumors that Alex G played guitar on some of these songs but I don't know if if you did on this one so we go pow like that then you're just going to take these two fingers scooch them up to the top two strings now you got third fret on the top string second fret on the second string for the top and just play at the top two strings and then finally we're gonna go to a little F power chord not a bar chord but a power chord you're gonna put your pointer finger on the first fret of the top string ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the top so we go you just play those top two strings so we just went the uh the chords change a little bit quicker in this part of the song it just goes so check it out we're gonna do that many many times but there are a couple other little chords sprinkled throughout for example right at the beginning we go [Music] and then he plays an A7 chord for some reason I have no idea why he plays it an A7 chord you don't play the top string second string from the top is open middle finger second fret third string from the top third string from the bottom is open then put your ring finger on the second fret of the second string from the bottom and then the bottom string is open a seven chord guys do not play the top string you can meet it with your thumb or in this case you can also just be really careful not to play it uh so you play that A7 you hold that A7 out for two beats I'll show you what I mean by that in a moment and then we go back to our F power chord so this was our like mini c chord this is our mini G chord and this is our F power chord so here's what we have for this second section the I care for you section he goes and then he goes a seven two and F power chord I panicked almost forgot about the F power chord uh let's go ahead why don't you go and play that part with me one two three four and oh yeah guys A7 one two then the F power chord great and then he goes like this again he does the does that again exactly the same and then he goes to a d chord D is middle finger second fret bottom string ring finger third fret second string from the bottom pointer finger second fret third string from the bottom you strum that once oh oh I should mention for this D chord you only want to play the bottom four strings if you play the if you play the second string from the top it's gonna sound a little muddy if you play the top string then it's all over game over strum the D card and we go back to our F power chord then we're just gonna do our c C record thing two more times there's a lot of stuff we've got bling bling blong and then A7 have power chord then we go bling bling blong D then our power chord then we go okay we're almost done with this section go back to the D again go back to the F power chord again and then you're gonna play C G the little mini C mini G again that was a lot of stuff let's play I'll play through it I'll walk you through it right now slowly one two the I have hair on my face two three four C G and then the A7 and the F power chord and then c g c g boom two then d one two then the F power chord then c g f again see G F then the D chord D then F power chord and then we go c g we did it we made it through that section guys we made it through that section we are moving on to the next section of the song but first let me just quickly make sure that I am actually recording I am good sometimes if it's like kind of like you know you forget to uh you go like did I lock the door did I make sure to turn the cat off and then um and then you have to go and double check and you almost always do but sometimes you don't that was me and that's what I do with recording I go did I press the record button foreign next section of the song we need an F major seven chord guys we've almost done this before but not quite remember our F major seven sus2 chord it's that but you put your middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the top so that means we've got nothing on the bottom string pointer finger on the first fret of the second from the bottom middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the bottom ring finger on the third fret of the third string from the top and then I am going to insist that you take your large thumb and you put it and just mute the top string nope not yet thought I had a burp coming didn't happen you're gonna do on this chord you're gonna strum it four times this is an F major seven chord one two three four by the way this chord is when he starts singing he sings in this life one two three four then we go to a D minor chord the only time we're gonna play A D minor chord in the entire song that's not true I just realized she has it one other time you're gonna put your pointer finger on the first fret of the bottom string ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom and middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the bottom once again mute the top string we're gonna strum this four times but there's a little catch look we go one two three wait what does he do here ah shoot I forget he does a little pull-off thing and I need to listen to it to remember how he does that I'll be right back I got it he plays the D Minor three times one two three then do you see what I did there I strummed it a fourth time but on the fourth strum I pulled off my pointer finger so you kind of like what you do is you pull your pointer finger down and kind of pluck the bottom string as you're pulling it down so it's one two three three four beautiful sound then you go back to the F major seven okay you're gonna strum this two times one two and then we're gonna go like this that was an E chord and a G chord E chord not to be confused with Igor the fictional character from Frankenstein Dracula I'm not sure it's gonna be top string open middle finger second fret second string from the top ring finger second fret third string from the top and pointer finger first fret third string from the bottom strum that only one single solitary time then you go to a G chord that is middle finger third fret on the top pointer finger second fret second string from the top skip the middle two strings and put your ring finger and Pinky on the third fret of the bottom two strings you're gonna strum that once and then we are what do we do that oh then we do that exact same thing and we go F major seven then e G again so far for this in in my life in this life part we go like this we go F major seven four times then D Minor two three pull off and F major seven sorry that e g then again F major seven and e g then uh now we're gonna go like this for some reason he does it a little bit differently this next time he goes F major seven then C G you remember the C chord from before so we're doing we're just we've replaced our e with a C okay okay and then we do the F major seven e g thing again F major seven e g then we do it again F major seven e g so let's play through this hole in this life section and just just follow my lead okay it starts with the F major seven one two three four one two three four then D Minor two three pull off F major seven then E G and F major seven E G and F major seven c g f uh major seven e sorry last four hour was for second F major seven e g and then we're almost done with this section we're gonna strum F four times and dma uh F4 to F major seven four times one two three four then we go back to the D minor seven you go one two e g and then the final part to this section you're gonna go f f g g holy smokes guys do we dare play through that whole part yeah we probably should one two F major seven F major seven three four then D Minor two three pull off F major seven and E G again F major seven e g then F major seven then C G F major seven E G again F major seven e g that F major seven four times and D Minor d G then F major seven g g only one more section to the song The outro the outro to the song and the outro guys guess what I have fantastic news for you you already know the outro to the song We already learned it I think yeah we did but we didn't call it look this is the outro the outro goes [Music] what all it is is our mini C our mini G and our F power chord we go third fret second string second fret third string from the top and you play those two then you just move those up to the top two strings three and two and then we go to one and three two [Music] does this so many times [Music] this song uh is so weird but also so like like not weird at the same time I kind of I always forget the song actually exists I kind of feel like it's just a dream I had it's very dreamy song You're dreamy you're dreamy and I hope that you've had a great dreamy time today and playing the song white Ferrari by Frank Ferrari it was I had a good time and now I'm just trying why do I do this why do I do this [Music] foreign [Music]"
