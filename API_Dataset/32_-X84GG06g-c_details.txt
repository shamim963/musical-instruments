    "Transcript": "hi welcome to guitar boot camp by the end you'll be so confident with the guitar that you could be hanging out with the pros and they'd be like hey this guy this guy knows guitar yeah sound good uh good so we're gonna be starting from the very top so bear with me if you're like i already know that's a guitar because things will get more complex as we go but it's important to really make sure we know all the basics so the harder stuff later makes sense guitar anatomy so guitars come in many different shapes and sizes there are three main classifications acoustic electric and classical we're gonna be focusing on acoustic and electric because they're approached more or less the same way whereas classical isn't so the basic guitar parts you should be familiar with are actually similar to something else that's right a giraffe so you've got the body the neck and the head stock now unlike a giraffe guitars have a nut tuning machines also called tuning pegs the fretboard which is on top of the neck frets which are on top of the fretboard now like a giraffe guitars have spots along the neck those are called inlays on most guitars they're dots but sometimes they're other shapes like diamonds squares bird and they used to help you quickly find frets while playing because without them where's the 13th fret uh i don't mean either but with them it's here right after the double dots which mark the 12th fret now onto the body they all have bridges which support the strings and most have pick guards which guard from picks now where they differ is and how they produce sound for example an unplugged acoustic sounds like this nice whereas an unplugged electric sounds like this not literally they do make a bit of sound and then they have pickups which pick up the sound and send it to the amp which amplifies it but the acoustic on the other hand has a sound hole do you know what that does it's a it's a hole for sound that's right tuning so in the age of modern technology you got about a dozen apps that can help you tune but you probably only need one but in case you're ever without a phone you can buy an electronic tuner or a piano and then you can tune the strings and reference the keys another option you can do is relative tuning that's when you tune the guitar to itself basically working down from the sixth string to the first string or the fattest string to the skinniest string play the fifth fret on one string and then tune the string below it to match the pitch except for tuning the b string which you match the fourth fret of the g string and by the end you should have a guitar that's perfectly in tune to itself and nothing else on the planet before you play so guitars are actually designed for humans so whether you're sitting or standing the way it naturally falls is basically how it should be but just in case generally you sit down to practice and stand to perform unless it's a really serious performance they sit on a stool with a spotlight so we'll start with sitting place the body of the guitar on your right leg with your right arm placed over it in a way that supports it so the neck stays parallel to the ground your left hand shouldn't have to support the neck in any way and if you're standing and playing you should use a strap and it should be about the same height as when you're sitting down slash so fretting is what you do with your left hand on the fretboard each string produces a single note which changes depending on what fret you play higher on the next a higher note lower on the next the lower note if you play three or more strings simultaneously that's a chord sometimes it seems easier to play a chord by contorting your body in weird ways and it might be but in the long term it can lead to permanent injury which is bad so i might over explain how to do it but it's important so make a loose fist with your left hand and put your palm to the sky your thumb should fall roughly in between your index and your middle finger don't overthink it too much and just make sure your shoulders are relaxed now when you play a note make sure your fingers come up perpendicular to the fretboard and not at an angle this prevents injury but it also prevents you from accidentally touching strings by mistake which is worse now your right hand is responsible for rhythm and there are two main ways to do it which will you pick some guitar humor for you with elastic guitars you almost exclusively use a pick and with an acoustic you can either use a pick or finger pick finger picking use your thumb to play bass notes which is strings six five and four and your index middle and ring fingers are used to play three two and one respectively now picks they come in a lot of sizes the rule is pretty much the less time you've been playing the thinner your pick should be and the good news is once you're used to it it's easy to upgrade so to hold the pick rest it on your index finger and put your thumb on top of it gently you want your grip on the pick to be relaxed so relax that it might fall out of your hand at times but tight enough that it won't and in general if you're strumming or playing chords or rhythm guitar use your elbow and wrist and if you're picking like just playing individual notes just use your wrist play a note so what's interesting about guitar compared to like piano so you got mozart in a room what's up guys so with a piano if you and mozart are both to hit the same key and only one key it'll sound basically the same when i say we got jimi hendrix hey fellas hey jim so if you and jimmy have the exact same guitar with the exact same setup if jimmy plays a note it might sound like this thanks jimmy now if you're new to guitar and you play the same note it might sound like this it's different and that comes down to experience knowing how hard to press finger strength and even your picking hand but as a general rule you want to press down as lightly as you can but still get a clear tone with no buzz so the goal is to have as little string tension as possible the way to do that is say you're playing the third fret on the sixth string and by the way playing the third fret means to play in the third box now in the box you want to place your finger as close to the third fret as you can without actually touching it because that's where the string has the least tension also electric guitars have lower actions than acoustics which means the strings are closer to the fretboard which also means less tension okay time to play a note you ready play this one um oh that's tablature basically how you read them bottom line corresponds with the sixth string the thickest string and the top line with the first string the thinnest string and the other lines in between are the strings in between and the numbers that are on the lines are what fret you have to play on that string a zero means you play an open string which means you press no frets chords so a chord is when you play three or more notes simultaneously which on guitar is playing three or more strings simultaneously there are all types of chords but the ones you absolutely have to know are bar chord for kidding it's open chords open chords are chords that consist of at least one string that's not fretted here's an example that's not that's a chord diagram how you read it is picture a guitar up against a wall and that's it so with everything we've learned in this video try and play this chord and if you're gonna pause here are some chord charts of chords that you should be familiar with and then once you get these down you'll officially be done with guitar bootcamp so congratulations thanks for watching guys let me know if i miss anything or maybe you can just say hi nice video and then that that also means a lot so um thanks guys and i'll see you again soon bye thanks to my patrons of course bye"
