    "Transcript": "you took a train to the south side of Boston you showed me where your M stay took 28 years of blood I was lost in a few loved on my own birthday and I always felt like I was in between something like home and good guys my name is Dave and welcome to another Guitar Hero song tutorial in this lesson I'm going to teach you how to play 28 by Brian for the basics we'll just need our guitar and standing tuning and we won't need a capo if you master CS back to front then be sure to head over to guitars ready hero.com top Pi at my free guitar ebook and finally this video Simply teaches you one song but if really understanding and learning the guitar is something you always wanted to do but you didn't know where to start then be sure to check out the guitars y hero premium course and membership which gives you all the guidance to play with confidence I'll leave a link to it in the description let's jump into the lesson okay so let's start off with the main verse progression and we're going to start off with the D four chord shape that looks like this now it's ringing pinky fingers on the fifth Frets of the fifth and fourth string the open third string and index finger goes on the third fret of the second string so we're focusing on the middle four strings here with the sixth string you can just mute that by lightly touching it with your thumb so that's our D sus4 then we go to D at 11 so just lift your pinky finger and your middle finger will naturally just hit the fourth fret of the four fourth string so it's the same as a c chord shape just up two Frets that's D at 11 then we're going to play a G chord so move your ring and middle finger to the fourth and third strings so that's our G and we just want to focus on the fourth third and second strings here you don't want the sixth and fifth string ringing out and you can do that by lightly muting it with your thumb reaching over the top or by just focusing on those three strings so that's G and then G sus4 take your pinky finger put it on the fifth fret of the third string so those are our four chord shapes now in terms of strumming pattern this song is in 6A timing so there's a one 2 3 4 5 6 feel to it for our strumming pattern you could use two different variations you could play down down down up or 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 six or you could remove one of the down strums and play more of a down up down up down up down up or 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 it's completely up to you just sort of feel it you can mix and match those two as well if you'd like we're going to play each cord with one strumming pattern I'm going to use the one without a down strum on the two and the five beat so it sound like this [Music] now one little thing that you can add is a bit of a hammer on on the first down strum for the Gus 4 so for the first down strum for that Gus 4 don't have your pinky finger already on that note Hammer onto it like that and that will sound like this it just adds a tiny bit of flare which sounds really nice that's it for the main verse progression now just before the chorus I'm just going to call this the pre chorus there's one extra bar of Gus 4 so it's the same chord progression as the verse but when we play the Gus 4 we're going to finish it in the second bar but then play it again for another full bar so the precourse [Music] now the only other chord progression to learn in this song is the chorus which is nice and simple there just four chords we have an E minor then a d chord A G chord and then a c chord and I'm going to strum this with a down down up down up twice for each chord so each chord will span a full bar of music [Music] so that's everything there is to learn for 28 now in terms of song structure we start off with the intro which is just the verse chord progression played through a number of times in the play through at the end I'm just going to be playing it through twice and then jumping to the verse but in the actual song it holds out for a little bit longer then there's first verse a pre chorus then our chorus then another verse another pre chorus then two choruses and then finally we end the song with one more verse so now I'll be doing a full playthrough of the song and I'll have a vocal track on top for some context a big thanks to my friend Eric for learning his awesome vocals to this playthrough feel free to play this back as many times as you'd like do to practice play along to and see how you go [Music] [Laughter] you took a train to the south side of Boston you showed me where your M stay to 28 years of blood I was lost in a f Lov on my own birthday and I always felt like I was in between something like home and somewhere far away T night on the west side in the bar out of Brooklyn I saw tears outline face how luy are we it's been hell of week you're all grown now the smoke SE it out of your bloody teeth but you home [Music] somehow and I'll be upstairs with we get to eyes given when I was
