    "Transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] people of the world this is pretend by Alex G we were in an interesting predicament we're in a Race Against Time because my battery is almost out battery's almost out I do not mean my physical battery Within Myself I'm in the battery in my phone and computer both of them are running low I feel like the video looks weird I updated things and now it's like is it choppy or does it look better I can't tell I can't tell let's didn't I just say I had to hurry up and now I'm doing this um I'll tell you what let's learn the song standard tuning standard tuning on the guitar we're gonna we've got this main riff and we've got a chorus and that's it so we're just gonna learn those two parts and then I'm going to go on a short little walk before I begin the rest of my day the main chord of the song is an E chord that is top string open middle finger on the second fret of the a string the second string from the bottom ring finger plays the second fret on the D string the third string from the top I said something weird there look at my fingers don't listen to my mouth and my words look at my fingers okay I'm doing that then pointer finger plays the first fret on the G string third string from the bottom that's our typical E chord if you don't know it get comfortable with it because this is one of the classic guitar chords of the ages uh what we're going to do first is I'm going to show you the first three chords then we're gonna take a step back and look at the Rhythm and the strumming so first chord is e we're gonna strum that a few times great then you're gonna keep those fingers there but add your pinky down to the bottom string that's the second fret of the bottom string there still an E chord but it's like an e add 9 chord you do not need to remember the name of the E at9 remember the name of the e this one though just think of it as e with the pinky great there it is then one more chord we're going to learn right now before we talk about the Rhythm I would like you two so slide your hand up to the fourth Frets now Pinky's on the fourth fret middle fingers on the fourth fret ring fingers on the fourth fret but you have to stretch your pointer finger back to the second fret on the G string so here's what happened I was on the E added my pinky to the second fret of the bottom string slid everything up to four except I left my pointer finger back to play the second fret of the G string that's the string it was already on so e add the pinky and then this one right here the most important note is the pinky on the fourth fret of the bottom string just to go through this note by note one more time we've got pinky on the fourth fret of the bottom string second to bottom string is open third string From The Bottom the G string we've got the pointer finger on the second fret then ring fingers on the fourth fret of the D string middle finger is on the fourth fret of the a string the second string from the top the top string can be open in or you can be muting it we're going to try not to hit that top string for this chord anyway let's go let's play these chords once each so E chord Igor pinky goes to Second fret of the bottom and then you slide up to four pointer finger on two there's that one what a beautiful chord am I right now let's talk about the Rhythm so keep those chords locked and loaded ready to go but for the next little hunk of time we're just gonna play the E chord here's the Rhythm we want to get used to playing we want to get used to down down up down up down up up up down down down up down up down up up down let's do that slower so that's down down up down up down down up down up down those first couples drums are slow down down down up down up down let's do that a couple times together one two practice with me here we go [Music] how'd it go one more time one two three four down down up down up down down after that you're gonna strum nice and slow up up up down down down down up down up down up up up down do that one more time together one two here we go and down [Music] up down that last down we just played is actually the first down of the whole pattern starting over again let's do it those times together that's Spanish for two surprise you to know that one two here we go and down down up down up down up up up down [Music] up up up down down down up down up up up up down I've said this before I'll say it again great thing to do to practice don't even don't even worry about strumming it just just tap it on your leg on your guitar on your head on your desk on your pillow I want you to go boom boom [Music] I want you to feel that Rhythm feel it like the back of your hand I feel this is me feeling the back of my hand that's a joke there I uh first video I did today I recorded the video for Matilda by LJ that was a complete and utter disaster closest I've had to a breakdown in the past in the past few days um then after that I recorded the lesson for a song uh called bad beer by Slaughter Beach dog that one I have to say had a very nice time doing it I had a lot of energy but now this is my third video of the day and I don't I I don't anticipate anything about it working out notice how when sometimes when I talk I just pick this up and then I just hold it and then I put it down get the Rhythm and the chords intertwined look down down on up down pinky slide up up [Music] see that right there then the next up the third up is just me getting ready to go back to the E chord again so I'm just kind of hitting open strings like this check it out see that down up down up down pinky up open E hey what and I might sometimes hit an extra little I might hit the strings at my way down a little bit in the middle once you get used to this the bones of this Rhythm um then you can do some improvising you can add little strums you can take out little strums little things will just happen organically that's all great that's all good and Good and Plenty um so that's the thing that I said to you [Music] that's the intro to the song it just goes [Music] four let's say four I might only do it two and just that that e part there I'm repeating myself many times for no reason then there's a drum break where no guitar happens then the singing starts so now once the singing starts I'm gonna call this part the verse of the song the verse goes like this he goes we do that twice then we go to a B minor Barre chord first chord from Hotel California what do you think about that Alex G Hotel California no relation pointer finger plays the second fret on the a string you are going to try to lay that finger flat onto all the strings I like to try to mute the E string with the tip of my pointer finger push on the second fret of the a string and if I can I try to push on the rest of the strings but honestly for being honest if if we could be honest with each other I'm going to tell you with with the B minor a lot of time I just mute the other strings because it's a lot of work to push down on them and it sounds fine if you just mute them middle finger plays the third fret on the B string the second string from the bottom ring finger plays the fourth fret on the D string the third string from the top and Pinky plays the fourth fret on the G string the third string from the bottom notice my thumb is back here this is all old news for Barre chord veterans but for those of you still getting used to Barre chords if your thumb's up over the top it makes it quite difficult bring your thumb down here you want your fingers to really be curved and wrap around so I'm not like this my wrist isn't bent my wrist I'm trying to keep it pretty straight B minor bar chord we play the same strumming down down up down up down up now we don't have to do any crazy slides we are gonna go like this however we're gonna go so what I just did there it was kind of sounded bad because I was sloppy with it after we strum up once I'm gonna just tilt my fingers at back so that now the bottom string is open so when I strum up the second time I'm hearing that open bottom string so it's like down down down up down up down up open so I'm going up up down whatever you know what I'm talking about [Music] and then we go to a different chord I would go to an a we go to an a chord you guys how's my battery life doing I think I'm gonna make it I'm at 14 and I mean there's no way this video is going to go on for longer than another what 30 seconds okay uh middle finger second fret on the D string third string from the top ring finger second fret on the G string third string from the bottom pinky second fret on the B string second string for the bottom this is our classic a chord remember the name of this one the a chord it's gonna go down in history mark my words same strumming down down up down up down up then when we strum up the second time you're gonna get rid of your pinky so now we have a couple more open strings in there that was my not great explanation of the verse let me play it for you one two um repeat that B minor then a and then we go back to the E I almost forgot did you see my Panic there for a second if you see what I'm doing here I'm just repeating the same thing again foreign how many times does he do the verse well that's a great question I'm gonna guess oh I'm gonna guess he does the verse four times but he might do it too um no one knows one of the greatest mysteries of this song is that I don't know how many times he's just the first then I think there's a solo every time he does a solo and if you think I'm gonna show you the solos you're dumb I'm not gonna show you the solos if you listen to those solos there's like two solos going on at the same time one in each year and it's it sounds cool but I don't want to deal with it let me hold this because I'm talking I have the talking cup it's empty I've lost my temper this is it this is the last video you can all go to your room I wrote a song for just such an occasion I've been writing a lot of songs for these lessons the song I wrote goes like this it goes It goes hey hey guys listen to my song I'm gonna play it for you because I wrote it all night long I am sure and I am here to teach it's a song I wrote about Alex G okay I'll show you that I'll show you that later but what we're going to do now is learn the what was I talking about the solos I'm not doing the solos uh what does he play during the solo he just plays the same chords that he plays during the verse for the solos let's learn the chorus shall we chorus goes like this [Music] thank you [Music] a lot of stuff there but don't worry I'm gonna go through it really quick so you can't understand it we start off by going [Music] so here's what happened that's classic E chord down down then we're going to this this is really close to the chord we did earlier in the song just a little bit different uh you can use whatever fingers you want we're gonna do middle finger on the fourth fret of the a string second string from the top ring finger on the fourth fret of the D string third string from the top pointer finger on the second fret of the G string the third string from the bottom we're gonna start them up on that I think and then go right back to the E so it's like this it's down down up down no I said something to down so that was e e hey up down down down up up down I don't want to I don't know what he says I don't want to or something it's called pretend so he probably goes pretend pretend pretend pretend that was the stupidest thing I've ever said in my entire life gotta put my sunglasses on so that you can't see my eyes because I'm so embarrassed of what I just did let me unzip this show off my reddish shirt what we call this brick red see how it changes subject immediately I'm Gonna Keep the glasses on for a little bit though so you can show off my ring light in there I think this ring light is working against me if we're being honest [Music] ly we did that I played a few times when I go down down up I'm gonna let you I don't know I've lost all my interest in teaching you this song then we go to a D major seven chord D major seven is a great one there are many ways to play it for this song I like to do pinky on the second fret of the bottom string ring finger on the second fret of the second to bottom string and then middle finger on the second fret of the third to bottom string we're gonna go down up down so on the D major seven we're going down up down try not to hit the top string the E string for this chord down and then go to an a all you have to do there is take your three fingers hop all of them up one string and strum down all right I think enough time has passed since my comment I don't even remember what it was I think it was somebody else who came in and made that really bad joke down up down a here's what we have for the chorus so far [Applause] and we go we do a couple of strums on the A and that's like the biggest cop-out is when I say just do a couple little strums down up down down up down down works pretty well down up down down up down down then back to the D major seven down up down down up down down so there's a lot of strumming I know just do get as close as you can down up down down up down down then it's gonna get weird we're gonna go back to our crazy chord that we did earlier remember the one we're in we're gonna go back to that chord you're gonna strum down up and then up to this guy this one is ring finger on the seventh fret of the a string pinky on the seventh fret of the D string middle finger on the sixth fret of the G string and then pointer finger on the fifth fret of the B string you're just gonna strum that once a lot of chords but like I told you I'm gonna go through a faster 10 battery I gotta hurry we're going [Music] [Applause] thank you that's I mean you can figure that out right from the things I said then we start the chorus over again but then instead of going to this chord we're going to a B minor we did that earlier do you remember it the Hotel California court and we're gonna go down up down up and then we go to a D Minor D Minor is you take your B minor bar chord which is on the second fret and you're going to slide it up one two three Frets so now your pointer fingers on the fifth fret ring finger seventh fret on the hello you awake seventh fret on the D string pinky seventh fret on the G string middle finger sixth fret on the B string this one we only we only really strum one time I guess he kind of is like a he does a couple of Tiny strums But we would really love the first strum to be really Crystal Clean and Clear of that D Minor bar chord I'm taking I'm chilling out now I'm chilling out then go to this guy so here's what this is this is oh we've done this this is our our crazy cord from before do you remember it remember that one if you can get your thumb play the second fret on the ties what does he do how does he do it you know now I think about not sure how he does this chord but but I've lost all interest we're so long into this video here's what I like to do thumb on the second fret of the top string ring finger on the fourth fret of the second string from the top pinky on the fourth fret of the next string and then my my little tiny little pointer finger plays the second fret on the bottom three strings I don't worry about the bottom two they're often kind of muted not a big deal we just strummed this chord once it's like an F sharp minor or something and then we go like this so that was just strung it then you wait four beats or let's see one two three three beats sorry one two three then so that's you strum it hard and then move one fret over so every single finger just moves one fret back so we're on one three three and one that again and then back to the beginning I think that's good I don't want to play through all of it I I don't anticipate anyone liking this video because of the quality and because of um mostly the quality but I did it and that's what counts [Music]"
