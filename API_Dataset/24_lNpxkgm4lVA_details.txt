    "Transcript": "[Music] this is a terrible idea i'm sick i'm tired i have not drank nearly enough water today and nobody even knows this song it's like a 10 year old song nobody's ever heard of why am i making this video today let's just do it let's just do it mary by alex g this song starts with this little a little count off thing he doesn't actually count he just he just plays these four little harmonic things to kind of kick the song off here's what i think he's doing i think i think he's playing a harmonic on the fifth fret so that's where you just a harmonic is where you don't actually push on the strings you just very lightly touch the string so i'm just using my pointer finger i'm very lightly touching the strings right on the fifth fret so i'm actually covering up the fret right there then i'm just going to hit the top few strings then i'm going to hit the bottom few strings so you get that little like that then i i'm not positive but i think he moves his finger over so it's like kind of like on like the three and a third fret it's like i find the third fret then just go a little bit further again we're doing harmonics which like i said is where you just really lightly touch the string then i play that twice you get this just kind of high pitch chimey quiet little sound one two three four something like that moving on to the actual song coolest part of the song right here he's playing a g major seven chord and a c major seven chord only three notes per chord let's do it middle finger tenth fret on the a string pointer finger ninth fret on the d string now you can use your ring finger i personally me if we're if we're being honest and i feel like we can be honest with each other i like to use my pinky to play the 11th fret on the g string i think i have food in my teeth it's attractive it's a good look when you have food in your teeth i was eating kale yeah i ate healthy food like kale there were also green beans and tofu in it it was what i call a healthy lunch but the thing about kale is it gets in your teeth and then you look really not it's not a good look having kale in your teeth a g major seven chord ten nine eleven i use my thumb to mute the e string i use my pinky in addition to playing the 11th fret my pinky is muting those bottom two strings like that i'm going to go ahead and play this chord twice then i'm going to switch to the c major seven chord which is like this take that same chord move one two frets back and then move up to the top string like that so now i'm on eight on the e string seven on the a string and my pinky has nine on the d string this is a c major seven chord doing each one twice [Music] then and only then i'm going to slide back up to that first chord the g major 7 chord the way i do that is i just get ready to play the g major 7 chord again but i start a couple frets back further and i just slide up to it so i'm going boom boom boom boom now when i'm playing this chord right now i'm doing a little faster than i did it before so i'm going like slow slow slow slow fast fast then back to the c major seven three strums slow fast fast boom bang bang bang that's a sorry e string tuner i hit you that's our first uh part of the song here what i'm gonna call intro part one we're going how many times we're gonna do it that's right four times quattro spanish for four i'm surprised you didn't know that [Music] there's one two [Music] i think i said that was two i've lost count here's the fourth one there we go then we go to the next part of the song i don't know what to call this part of the song this song is weird alex g weird guy writes weird songs the singing starts right here but i'm gonna call this intro part two because i don't think this is the verse it's definitely not the chorus this is like intro part two we're gonna go like this [Applause] let's do it open e string just like that my computer just turned off let me just uh get it going again okay it's good we're still we're still we're still recording i had to check several times to make sure we were still recording open e string then we're gonna play e minor nine chord what a beautiful chord don't you agree here's how you play the e minor nine chord middle finger seventh fret on the a string see that i have no life in my eyes do you see how deathly tired i am middle finger seventh fret on the a string pointer finger fifth fret on the d string is kind of a stretch it's kind of a stretch but i think you can handle it ring finger seventh fret on the g string then pinky your little baby little pinky is going to play the seventh fret on the b string so now we've got this open e then seven five seven seven that high e string it can be muted it can be open i don't even care you do whatever you want e minor nine chord check this out open e e minor nine chord and we're gonna go like this abandon the e minor nine chord place seventh fret on the e string fifth fret on the a string then play seventh fret on the d string now i'm going to ring finger pointer finger ring finger then slide up to the ninth fret on the d string [Music] look at that hardest part here is probably your pick over here with your right hand navigating those strings pinkie pop gow then go back to seventh fret on the a string then middle finger plays eighth fret on the e string and then from that eighth fret you're gonna slide down to the third fret did you see how horribly sloppy that slide was as i was sliding my middle finger went off the string then back onto the string i am in no condition to be doing a youtube video right now [Music] that's what we just did next little next the second part of intro part two middle finger third fret on the e string pointer finger second fret on the a string it's like a little first top half of a g chord you're gonna play [Music] see that i just played those top three strings binky bow then move your uh let's see get rid of your middle finger keep your pointer finger on the second fret of the a string and then bring your ring finger to the fourth fret of the d string and you're gonna play the top three strings again like this so that's three two zero zero two four play those same two little ar what's it called when you play an uh uh a pop quiz pop quiz what do you what is it called when you play a chord one note at a time that's right it's called an arpeggio that's probably italian or french for another word i think sounds like the french word for fish but i don't think it is i think it's something different oh man what do you think the chances are that i don't just totally give up and not record this video today do the same to arpeggios fish again but the second time you play that second chord a little bit earlier to hear that it's like [Music] you anticipate it you play it a little bit ahead of the beat then what you go back to the c major seven chord that's the first chord we learned in this song not c it's a g major seven chord get your act together you do that again you do that again [Music] that that whole thing there is what i call intro part two you're going to play intro part two two times i think we've spent enough time on intro part two we are now going to transition in what into what i call the next part of the song this i guess this is the verse but it might be the chorus it's unclear the song follows an interesting and interesting form an interesting order of parts check this out here's the next part [Music] here's what i just did this is a g bar chord i'm gonna walk you through it real my computer fell asleep again we're good don't worry don't panic the g bar chord pointer fingers pushing on every single string on the third fret ring finger plays the fifth fret on the a string pinky plays the fifth fret on the d string middle finger plays the fourth fret on the g string i feel like maybe some of what i just said was accurate i'm gonna play this chord twice then we're going to a d minor bar chord here's how you do that you take this g bar chord you just move it two frets over so now we're on the fifth fret then you move it one string down like that d minor bar chord not playing the top string fifth fret on the a string seventh fret on the d string seventh fret on the g string sixth fret on the b string and then if you like your pointer finger can get that fifth fret down on the high e string so check this out that was the g d minor on the d minor we're going to strum down up so it's g d minor i see that then we're going to switch to an a minor bar chord take this d minor bar chord just go one string up so now you're on the top strings like that you see what i just did here's the d minor go up to here then get rid of your middle finger what i like to do when i'm playing a minor bar chord up here is my middle finger smashes down onto my pointer finger so that i can get all the strings a little bit more comfortably you're gonna play up up on that a minor then we go to a c bar chord take your a minor bar chord move one two three frets further up the next so now your pointer fingers on the eighth fret take your middle finger put it on the ninth fret of the g string like that like that you see what i'm doing here see that we've done this shape before it's the same shape as our g we're just up on the eighth fret on this chord you're gonna strum up up down a lot of chords we just did we've got g g down up up up up down let me do that a couple times you can play along with me get used to the flow of this part of the song [Music] so i just played it several times but do you want to know how many times he actually plays that in a row in the actual song [Applause] one time he plays it one time one then we're going to go to an e minor here's here this i just want to sleep e minor bar chord seventh fret on the a string ninth fret on the d string ninth fret on the g string middle finger eighth fret on the b string that's an e minor bar chord watch this what did i just do i'll tell you e minor bar chord one two just like that now go one string up here so i just took this shape moved it up like that so now i'm on the top few strings see that like that then i'm right there so that's seven nine nine oh but then get rid of your middle finger and if you'd like you can have your middle finger smash down on your pointer finger like that so we've got seven nine nine and then seven seven seven play this chord once then take this same chord move it back one fret so it's on the sixth fret then back another fret to the fifth fret uh that was fun right let's see it again one two three four [Music] then play me the sixth fret on the e string and then go to the seventh fret on the e string after you play that seventh fret it's from this b minor chord for i didn't name any of these chords what is disaster what an utter complete failure of a disaster of a day and and a life this is a b minor chord in case you were interested e minor b minor b flat minor a minor [Music] so i went six seven and then strum the whole b minor chord [Music] what is even happening here's what we just did [Music] that's what we just did that's like the verse or whatever you want to call it okay let's keep going let's keep charging ahead ninth fret on the a string with the pointer finger ring finger plays the 11th fret on the d string pinky plays the 11th fret on the g string then every time i do that [Music] makes me think of the 2001 space odyssey thing my computer fell asleep again we're good we're good uh and then middle finger plays the tenth fret on the b string do you see what i'm doing here if you haven't noticed we're doing a lot of these barre chord shapes in this song we're actually we actually are making some progress with the song we are going to get through it it is going to happen this is called an f-sharp minor chord what are my feelings on the names of these chords well i mean i think they're fine it's what they're called so what am i going to hate them i'm going to love them i don't love them i don't i don't love the names but i don't hate them they're fine do you need to know the names of these chords well i mean it's helpful right if you know the names of these chords that's great but do you need to know the names to play them no i just think you're treating me really unfairly today i think that you know that i'm in a bad mood today and i don't know why you're like poking at me you're like trying to make me more upset i really would appreciate it if you would just be supportive and help me get through this day f sharp minor then we're going to a b minor chord we've already played a b minor do you remember what it was no it was pointer finger on the seventh fret of the e string then ninth fret ninth fret and then you're putting your finger smash it down on everything else your middle finger can help i wasn't flipping you off i was just showing you what to do with your middle finger your middle finger goes onto the i i smash it onto my pointer finger to help it push on all the strings oh that was sloppy you see that i'm going boom boom boom then i do it again just with a little bit of a different rhythm we just played a lot of stuff we just played a lot of stuff we're not going to review it yet we're going to charge ahead we just did f sharp b minor f minor b minor okay a g bar chord we did a g bar chord over here but now we're doing that up here why because that's how alex g does it i don't know crazy kid alex g pointer finger 10th fret of the a string a ring finger is going to play the 12th fret on the d string your ring finger is going to smash down and also hit the 12th fret on the g string and also play the 12th fret on the b string your ring finger is playing three different strings now i used to hate playing this chord i was like bending my ring finger like this literally makes me want to throw up it actually made me physically nauseous but i kept with it i got some flexibility i trained the muscles in that finger and now i can play this chord comfortably and i love it like my own mother g bar chord playing it twice then there's another chord let me check my notes [Applause] you made me drop it yeah so we play the g then we go to a d major bar chord here's how we do that or we could go down here but that's not how alex g does it and we have to do everything how alex g does it because he wrote the song all right so uh uh so we got this this is the g then you're going to put your pointer finger on the 10th fret of the e string then you're gonna put your ring finger on the 12th fret of the a string pinky on the 12th fret of the d string middle finger on the 11th fret of the g string make sure your pointer finger is you can push down on all six strings if you want or just make sure that the base of your pointer finger is touching those high couple strings to mute them because we don't want to hear those open bottom strings we we really just want to hear these four lowest strings all right so we've got [Music] so here's what i'm doing here g g then on the d i'm going down up then we're going to the uh a minor bar chord we've done that before that's fifth fret seventh fret seventh fret pointer finger and middle finger smash down on the fifth fret of every string up up then we go to the c bar chord you go to the eighth fret it's gonna be eight whatever that is ten ten and then uh you know nine right there watch this [Music] time to review time to review we did the whole intro the thing with that remember that all right we did all that then we got to the next part of the song or i guess the verse i don't know that was where we went like this [Music] we do that just one time then we do this guy [Music] we do that just one time then we go to the part we just played no no no no no no then we go to the f sharp this is on the ninth ninth fret we do that i think just one time everything is just one time yeah it's one time do you see me just sneak a quick look at my notes over there then we do the part we just played finally we do this two times finally there's a part of the song we played twice one [Music] two and there's another part i'm gonna i totally remember what it is i remember what it is without looking at my notes yeah see i totally didn't look at my notes we do this again remember do you remember this [Music] we do that part again but this time we do it twice we've almost learned the entire song no that's not true i have almost just spit at you a bunch of notes that make up most of the song everything we just played we play another time then it gets to what i like to call the crazy part of the song there's these four measures in the song where alex g and his band just play nonsense it's crazy one guitarist goes like this [Music] and then alex g himself at least when he plays live he goes like this not even joking this is literally what happens the bass player goes like he doesn't throw his pick on the ground but i mean you could throw your pick on the ground if you want on the recording it sounds like there's one guitar that goes like this and that is what that is what i am choosing to show you it's a weird part of the song i i legitimately think that there are four bars where he just went let's just have this part of the song sound weird and wrong and noisy uh which i you know what for being honest i'm gonna approve i'm gonna approve of of this message check it out here's the way we're gonna do it b flat bar chord six eight eight seven you're gonna play that twice and then we're gonna go to our e minor bar chord which we've already done which is seven on the a string then nine then nine and then eight so we're going boom boom boom boom boom boom do that again there's a clock up there i'm looking at the time it's about 1 50 153 what do we do after that after the crazy part well after the crazy part we're gonna play that whole main part of the song again this is the first time i've used the phrase main part of the song when i say main part of the song here's what i mean i'm about to play the whole thing for you watch this [Music] that's the main part of the song he plays that whole entire thing again what do you think happens after that if you can tell me what happens after that then i will not show it to you it's easy he plays intro part one again he goes no [Music] uh he plays the whole intro he plays it [Applause] two times that was intro part one that was intro part two what even what is this what are we doing here's how the song ends after he plays that whole intro twice second time he goes no [Music] just ends on that chord right there that's the whole thing guys that's the whole thing so basically i like playing the song on guitar and i thought maybe you would like to play it too um but i regret my decisions here today and i look forward to seeing you in the next lesson there are solos in this song i didn't teach them to you i'm not sure i taught you anything"
