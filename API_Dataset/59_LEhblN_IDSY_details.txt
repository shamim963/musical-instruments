    "Transcript": "this is going to be a good tutorial 1 [Music] two don't even try don't have to [Music] Shang Schwing Fang Juno by claro Jun by claro you know she pulled a 180 trickster scam trick on us people of the world friends and relatives standard tuning you can play I think this song is equally at home on electric or acoustic guitar I just happen to play it on an acoustic guitar because that's what I happen to have with me at the moment I actually have both look I'm going to make a really cool thumb ah I'm going to make a really cool thumbnail do I have the strength for it ow that's my thumbnail right there hold it and three two one stop oh I need to take a break introduction B diminished chord put your middle finger on the seventh fret of the top string kind of use like the pad of your middle finger and then lean it down so it just mutes the second string from the top put your pointer finger on the six threat of the third string from the top and then here's what you're going to hate you also need to mash your pointer finger down so it pushes on the sixth fret of the third string from the bottom and the second string from the bottom to make matters even worse we would like the bottom string to be muted then take your ring finger and put it on the seventh fret of the third string from the bottom so check it out we'll walk through this chord note by note real quickly first thing is the top string you're on the seventh fret with your middle finger second string from the top is muted the next one your pointer finger is pushing on the sixth fret the next one your ring finger pushing on the seventh fret the next one your pointer finger is mashing down onto on the sixth fret then the bottom string is muted by your pointer finger you also can use like your like pinky or something to mute the bottom string if you want but I don't think you'll need to this is the B diminished seventh chord if it sounds hideous that means you're doing it right you're going to strum that chord and you're going to hold it out for two beats one two then we go to a much easier chord the C Minor 7 chord pointer finger eight on the top string your pointer finger leans down and mutes the second string from the top and then you have middle finger on eight ring finger on eight pinky on eight like that and you strum this and hold it out for two beats then we're going to throw in the little keyboard Melody thing that goes pointer finger third fret bottom string middle finger fourth fret second string from the bottom play just the bottom two strings then move your pointer finger up to the fourth fret on the bottom and use your ring finger to place six on the second string from the bottom play the bottom two strings then take this exact same little finger configuration and move one two Frets over so now pointer fingers on six ring fingers on eight play the bottom two strings and then we're going to play a cooky crazy a flat major 7 chord pointer finger third fret bottom string middle finger fourth fret second string from the bottom ring finger fifth fret third string from the bottom pinky sixth fret third string from the top we've just got this big old staircase this big diagonal line three four five six play the bottom four strings so that little thing was wow try that little thing with me here we go [Music] wowowowow a little bit tricky right this song is kind of hard but I do have a beginner guitar course available at Marin music.com you might enjoy it you also could recommend it or get it for a gift for your nieces and nephews your cousins your siblings CU they suck at guitar and I know you want to start a family band and you're like guys if we want to get this thing together like the Jackson or Donnie and Marie we're going to we're going to have to step on the throttle and you're going to have to start getting your act together we have to learn the rest of the intro we just did this thing then you're going to go to a G7 sharp N9 this is also known as the Hendrix chord middle finger 10th fret second string from the top pointer finger ninth fret third string from the top ring finger 10th fret third string from the bottom and Pinky on the 11th fret of the second string from the bottom play only those middle four strings the four strings you're pushing on wait two beats and then you're going to switch to a G7 flat n you get rid of your pinky and you take your pointer finger and you mash it down so it's pushing on the third string from the top third string from the bottom and the second string from the bottom and play the middle four strings G7 flat nine we are almost done with the introduction go to the 10th threet on the second string from the top put your pointer finger there then put your ring finger on the 12th fret of the third string from the top this is the bad news your pointer finger has to mash down on the 10th fret of the bottom five strings this is a bar chord then take your middle finger and put it on 11 of the second string from the bottom guys you're going to play the bottom five strings for this G minor seven chord then very quickly you're just going to scooch it over one fret so now you're on Ninth fret with your pointer finger 10th fret with your middle finger 11th fret with your ring finger play that to g flat minor 7 then move it over again so now you're on 8 n and 10 this is an F minor 7 and then move it one more so you're on Seven 8 and N this is an E minor 7 so we go blang bling bling bling and then we play an E flat major 7 chord pointer finger six second string from the top ring finger eight third string from the top middle finger seven third string from the bottom and Pinky eight second string from the bottom and from the middle four strings there it is guys that was a lot of CHS we just did the good news is we're done with the intro the bad news is you're like Uncle Stewart you might be done with the intro I don't really understand what just happened let's practice that last little part where we just go fanky bony bang get the G minor 7 chord ready to go you're on 10 with a pointer finger 11 with the middle finger 12 with the ring finger one two nice and slow and fangy bangy E flat major 7 the first four chords are pretty easy because you just move them over that last one you have to switch pretty quickly but I think you can handle it the good news is your pointer finger and your ring finger are just going to Glide along the two strings does that make sense all right let's try that part again one two here we go and flang let's play the whole entire introduction all the way through starting with that chord that you don't remember at all the B diminished cord it's okay you can rewind back to the beginning you're going to be fine one two karate chop Rambo one two then the C Minor 7 [Music] then then up to this one I forgot about this then this one [Music] wyy it's not my fault it's Claro's fault it's always her fault that's why I've been saying this whole time nobody believes me let's learn the verse the verse starts with an F minor 9 chord middle finger eigh fret second string from the top pointer finger sixth threet third string from the top I know it's a weird stretch but you can do it I recommend not trying to like push your fingers apart like that I recommend having them kind of fan out like that you see what I'm doing not like this tilt them over so they're coming at the strings at an angle and that way they can be close to each other you just well you just flip everybody off is I guess what you do then take your ring finger and put it on the eighth fret of the third string from the bottom then take your pinky and put it on the eighth fret of the second string from the bottom so top string we're not using and then we have 8 6 88 bottom string we're not using F minor 9 very similar to the E minor 9 chord in Mary by Alex G if you guys know that one just one fret over strum the middle four strings hold it out for four beats one 2 2 3 4 then we're going to switch to a B flat 13 lift up every finger except for your pinky your pinky stays on eight of the second string from the bottom put your pointer finger on six of the top string it's not a bar chord but you do want your pointer finger to lean down and mute the second string from the top put your middle finger on six of the third string from the top put your ring finger on seven of the third string from the bottom B flat 13 strum it and hold it out for four beats 1 2 3 4 let's practice those two chords going from the F minor 9 to the B flat 13 remember pinky doesn't move 1 2 3 two then we go to an E flat major 7 chord we already did the EF flat major 7 chord do you remember it it was pointer finger six second string from the top ring finger eight third string from the top middle finger seven third string from the bottom pinky eight second string from the bottom one two and you hold it out for eight beats then we do the C Minor 7 again which we already learned that was eight on top mute the next one then 8 88 guys let's play those four chords in a row F minor 9 B flat 13 E flat major 7 C Minor 7 wait a minute it hang on a second the pinky doesn't move the entire time I just realized that look pinky right there pinky right there pinky right there incredible your pinkies is holding this whole thing together one two and the F minor 9 chord [Music] one B flat 13 karate chop taond E flat major 7 switch to the C Minor 7 chord p po poop p PE after that we do basically the same thing again you go to the F minor 9 again hold it out for four beats then we're going to go to a B flat sus you could do the B flat 13 again and it would be fine but the B flat sus is way cooler pointer finger six fret second string from the bottom middle finger seventh fret third string from the bottom pinky eighth fret third string from the top ring finger eighth fret top string this is how Ste Steve Lacy plays it when he plays this chord the way I do it is I go pointer middle ring finger and then my thumb plays eight on the top this is easier for me to use my thumb but for a lot of people they don't like using their thumb in which case you go like that both methods are completely appropriate this is a B7 sus chord then we go to E flat major 7 exactly like we did before then you go to C Minor 7 exactly like you did before so that the so okay great I me amazing we're doing great so the verse so far is we went F minor 7 B flat 13 E flat major 7 C Minor 7 then we did F minor 7 or F minor 9 they're sort of the same thing and then we did the B flat sus and then we went E flat major 7 C Minor 7 now after you strum the C Minor 7 you're going to go like this check out it goes one two so you strum it and you count to two one two then on the second string from the bottom play eight and hammer on to nine and then play eight again then you wait for just a moment then play eight on the third string from the bottom and then eight on the third string from the top so it's one two play it with me here we go strum and you go back to F minor 9 I think we're at the chorus now I think that's the verse and now we're starting the chorus F minor 9 1 2 don't even try that's when she sings don't even try so you hold the F minor 9 out for four beats go to the B flat sus again hold it out for four beats one two and then you go to E flat major 7 hold it out for four beats 1 2 3 4 and then you come to the hardest part of the song it's very very short it goes like this three and four four chords in quick succession starting off with a B flat over D chord your pointer finger mashes down on the third fret of the second string from the bottom third string from the bottom third string from the top like this and then with your ring finger play five on the second string from the top and play the middle four strings just one strum you only hold it out for one beat then we go to an E flat six chord middle finger plays six on the second string from the top pointer finger mashes down on five of the middle two strings and ring finger plays six second string from the bottom one strum One Beat and then we go to an F diminished seventh chord you're not going to like this one but at least it's not a bar chord put your middle finger on eight of the second string from the top ring finger on nine of the third string from the top pointer finger on seven of the third string from the bottom and Pinky on nine of the second string from the bottom and play the middle four strings here's my little tip for this chord don't try to have your pointer finger exactly Place seven on the third string from the bottom instead just kind of mash your pointer finger down then you don't have to aim you can just kind of get close and you're good to go that helps me one strum of this F diminish seventh chord and then you move on to another chord A G7 chord put your middle finger on 10 of the second string from the top Point your finger on nine third string from the top ring finger on 10 of the third string from the bottom and just play those three strings so that was fangang pling plang it's going to take a lot of practice let's do those four really really really slowly but you're going to want to do this on your own like a 100 times one two here we go and flang fing diminished G7 one more time a little bit slow andang and and okay great guess what happens next you play the intro again do you remember the intro we had the B diminish then the C Minor 7 and then okay in the intro we went like this you can do that if you want but at this point you're singing and everything you probably don't want to worry about that so here's what you can do instead we're going to play a B minor 7 to an E flat 9 to an A flat major 7 so what I'm saying is instead of going we can go like this a little bit easier pointer finger fret top string mute second string from the top and then go sixth fret sixth fret sixth fret this is a B flat minor 7 then lift up your pointer finger move your middle finger to six on the second string from the top and then put your pointer finger on five of the third string from the top this is an E flat n chord just one strum of each blang blong and then a classic a flat major 7 chord pointer finger plays four on the top string and it mutes the second string from the top ring finger plays Five third string from the top pinky plays Five third string from the bottom middle finger plays Four second string from the bottom strum this hold it out for two beats guys that's this is there's so much stuff here we'll play through the whole chorus in a minute so you can see how it all fits together but what we just did was B diminished C Minor 7 then Fang fing then we finish up the rest of the int intro exactly like we did when we actually played the intro we go [Music] frangang fry Binky po then we play the intro again so it's B diminished C Minor 7 E B flat E flat a flat then up to this thing this thing fanky pinky B we just do it exactly the same again oh my goodness what a mess all right let's play the whole chorus all the way through so you can see how all the chords work together we're starting right after we go C Minor [Music] 7 that right there that little lick is sort of the lead into the chorus and then you know that you're officially in the chorus when the singing goes I don't even try that's the beginning of the chorus got it and the chord is an F minor 9 so starting right there 3 4 I F minor 9 don't even try B flat sus then E flat major 7 1 two then the hard part here we go B flat over d e flat 6 F diminished G7 then the intro B diminished then C Minor 7 and then our then up to the G7 sharp n g G7 flat n then fanky bingy bow then the intro [Music] again up to the G7 sharp9 G7 flat 9 FY bingy Po and then now we've made it to the second verse guys I have such good news for you the second verse is exactly the same as the first verse guys I have fantastic news for you after that you go to the chorus and the second chorus is exactly the same as the first chorus people of the world friends and relatives I have amazing news after that there's an instrumental section the instrumental section is just the verse again and then the chorus again and then the song ends it ends the song ends with f blanky E flat major 7 we've done it we've learned the whole thing if you just want to play and sing just go intro Verse Chorus Verse Chorus if you have a full band then you can do Verse Chorus Verse Chorus Verse Chorus with all the instrumental stuff at the end I don't have a full band that's going to play this once upon a time I had a full band but that band broke up guys we're still friends but I don't actually know if that's true because I haven't talked to the singer in like I think it's been like two years I said online to him I said like hey and he was like hey I think that was about it so we're basically best [Music] friends I believe that the actor who played fair in The Lord of the Rings movies did a great job and I think he did an even better job in the Netflix Iron Fist series which I am prepared to admit for the first time was my favorite of all of the Marvel Netflix serieses one two oh"
