    "Transcript": "[Music] hey what's up you guys Marty Schwarz here hope you are doing well I'm going to break this one down for you we're going to zoom in uh learn kind of the the the chord pattern and then work on a little right hand thing now it was funny I saw Paul McCartney the last time he was uh in my town in San Diego and he actually when he played this song he said oh I looked at YouTube videos of people teaching this song and playing it and they're playing it wrong and uh I just thought that was funny um so what I did is I basically broke it down by ear so I can teach it the best way I can so Paul I'm sorry if it's not 100% but I think it's pretty darn close I know the chords are right and all that anyway we're going to have fun it's going to sound right uh also thanks for the support subscribe to the channel let me know what songs you want to learn leaving comments liking the video come with me on this next chapter so anyway let's zoom in break this one down though here we go all right so I'm going to show you the chords first and then we'll start working on some patterns here but right even with the chords we're going to be using our yeah we're going to be using our thumb and our middle finger to pluck or pin inch two notes at the same time and the first one is this one so I've got my ring finger on the third fret of low E and then the open B string so it's like a G [Music] chord we're just play with the thumb on the low E and the middle finger on the B that's our first [Music] chord then index fingers is going to go to the first fret of the B string and with the thumb we're going to hit the open a and the middle finger on that b string so you put those [Music] together and then the next one is kind of like a G again but it's the second fret on the a string which is the third of the G and then the third fret of the B [Music] string I mean I guess you could call that B minor as [Music] well so we have the first one the the third fret and the open B then the open a in the first fret on the B then ring finger goes up to the third of the B and index on the second of the a [Music] then we take this uh kind of little index finger as a tracking point and we get up to the 10th fret right there and then ring finger is going to be on the 12th fret of the B so 10 on the a 12 of the B so everything so far has had our middle finger on the B in [Music] now with this shape the next part you scoot it down so the index is on the third of the A and ring is on the fifth of the [Music] B three and [Music] five then we scoot it up to seven on the a eight on the B so three and five seven and [Music] eight then fifth fret on the A and seventh fret on the B so from this one [Music] [Music] so now we move up to the ninth on the A and the 10th on the B and these are the only two shapes you're going to see pretty much so N9 and 10 and then we take this exact same shape and Scoot it down a whole step and so then that would be seven and eight seven on the a eight on the [Music] B from the top [Music] next [Music] part now this is a cool move right now we're currently on the seven of the A and the eight of the B all I'm going to do is move my index down a half step so then you're left with six of the A and eight of the B so [Music] That's goes down a half [Music] step and so when it does that it's now five of the A and seven of the B then up again to the seven of the a eight of the B then this is kind of the final little Cadence here we have the three of the A and the five of the B which now it's like a C major chord so let's do uh the second part [Music] here half step down seven and eight and three and five now this gets fun this part I like probably playing the most on the song So it starts on the three and the five and then that five of the B has middle finger now on the four of the B so you go which is like a classic Beatles thing C major C minor but he's doing it with finger picking so C major middle finger goes to the four C minor then we scoot that down a half [Music] step then the a becomes open and the middle finger goes to the second fret which just kind of like a A7 chord or an a chord so check it out [Music] and then finally index down to the first as you can see it's [Music] going with different bass notes so you've [Music] got open a second fret of B and then finally index finger is what I'm using on the first fret of the B and then my thumb is the only time it moves over now to the D string so it's like a D7 chord so open D first fret on the B and then the very first chord I showed you the third it's the G so the third fret of the low E and the open B [Music] now here are the chords from the [Music] top and then it would do that again but the next [Music] section hold step down ah half step [Music] down open D first fret B and the first [Music] chord for [Music] so here's a good starting point for the pattern there there is also uh a couple other sections that I'm going to show you H as we go but let's start now making some music the first chord and then with our index finger we can play that open G after that little pinch okay then the next one we do the same thing so next one we do the same thing this one we do the same thing and so there's a little pattern I'm doing which is the pinch then the open G string just like we did before so we have pinch G so after the open G then I hit the thumb on the a string again here it is again they're the same [Music] note after I hit the a string then I hit the B string so it looks like this again [Music] after I hit the B string then I go to the a string again so again oops sorry and the pinch that's the pattern is pinch g string a string B string a string pinch starts over again [Music] so the next section you can do the same thing now I was just listening to it again and I almost feel like he's not hitting that open G string in between he's so you could do what I showed [Music] you and then the rest of this walk down is the pattern I was showing you right here [Music] uh the pattern and so the last chord where it's the same pattern that I was doing up here but on that final chord instead of the a string with the thumb it's the D string uh so [Music] and then on this on these walk UPS in between you can it sounds cool in between you can hit the open G in between each each pinch you can add the open G for extra [Music] flavor pattern pinge pinch pattern [Music] so there's this little thing that happens in between the verses it's this little turnaround and it's what we were doing but it's basically a so it's the third and the fifth of the B then the second and the third so second of the a third of the B then the open a and the two of the B then the open D and the one of the B and then it starts over so it looks like this [Music] then we finally need the uh [Music] with the a aut so that new section where he goes black bird sorry black bird I'm not going to sing [Music] it into light I guess I li I can't resist that part so it goes like this which is like an F chord and it's the what is that it's the eighth of the A and the 10th of the [Music] B then seven of the a eight of the B then that a whole step down which would be five and six then three and five then one and three back up to the three and five then it starts over again 8 and 10 seven and [Music] 8 five and six three and five then one and three and then it does that normal walk down open a and two on the B open d one on the [Music] B and you add that pattern turn uh on the certain parts that you need like this [Music] uh so I'm doing that same pattern as this one on the parts that you see right here and then here and then regular pinches regular thing now [Music] for [Music] all right that was it thanks so much for taking the journey
