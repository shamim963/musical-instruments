    "Transcript": "[Music] thank you [Music] jigsaw falling into place by Radiohead uh it's in a weird tuning other than that it's great so let's just do the weird tuning get it over with then we'll learn the song top string tune down one full step to d d as in Darth Vader second string from the top is controversial guys some sources say it remains at the standard a some say you tune up a full step to B um I've watched live footage of Radiohead performing the song and I have determined that the tuning for the second string from the top is inconclusive we're barely gonna play that string so what I do is I leave it at a because when you tune up you run the serious risk of breaking the string so we're just gonna keep it at a and it's gonna be great the third string for the top remains at the standard D tuning the third string from the bottom you're gonna tune down one half step to F sharp second string from the bottom remains at the standard B and then the bottom string another another controversial subject this one does it remain at the standard e or do you tune it down a full step to D it doesn't really matter because we're not really going to use that bottom string but I tune it down to D so d a d f sharp b d I have a link for how to do alternate tunings or a video or whatever so guys let's learn the song middle finger ninth fret on the top string ring finger is gonna play ninth fret on the third string from the top pointer finger plays the eighth fret on the third string from the bottom your middle finger in addition to playing the ninth fret on the top string your middle finger is just gonna lean over and just touch the a string to mute the a string your middle fingers job for almost the entire song is gonna be to mute the a string the second string from the top this is our first chord of the song using your pick or plectrum if you will you're going to play the top string then you're gonna play the third string from the top and then plucking up you're gonna play the third string from the bottom so that was just top third from the top up on the third from the bottom you're gonna play those three notes twice in a row one two three one two three then just play the top string and then play the third string from the bottom pucking up so it goes like this one two three one two three one two that Rhythm and that picking is going to last for quite a bit of the song Let's Play just on that one gourd that one little riff that one little short little rhythmic repeated guitar part let's do that three times no don't do it don't do it let's play it four times okay one two very slowly one two three one two three one two one two three one two three one two halfway there last time one two three one two three one two you did so well I'm so impressed with the way you picked those notes you're the best nose picker in the world after you do that you're just gonna take your hand and you're gonna move it one fret over but Kate keeps the same shape so that means middle fingers on eight ring fingers on eight pointer fingers on seven just going to the ninth fret to the eighth fret you're gonna do the same exact picking pattern but you're gonna do it dose times that's Spanish for two I'm surprised you didn't know that after that things get a little crazy lift up your middle finger and lift up your pointer finger but keep your ring finger on that string and then just slide your ring finger to the seventh fret on the third string from the top add your pinky to the seventh fret on the third string from the bottom you're gonna do the same exact picking but only one time then immediately following that get rid of your pinky and put your pointer finger on the fifth fret of the third string from the bottom do the same picking one more time this is a fantastic time to practice what we have thus far we're gonna do the first chord cuatro times the next one dose times then one time and Uno times I used a different word to describe each of the number of times one two not too fast and one two three four here we go one two here we go one and one you're doing great you ready for the next part let's just go ahead and do the next part you can abandon those the strings with those fingers put your middle finger on the fifth fret of the top string do the same picking but only do it like the only do the first three notes just go one two three so I'm just doing top string going down to the open third string from the top and open third string from the bottom I'm still plucking down down up that down down up is a big deal guys make sure you do it we've got down down up take your ring finger put it on the fifth fret of the third string from the bottom do the same three notes again but now your ring finger is there go back up to the top string then with your pinky I just spit oatmeal on my guitar so relax your ring finger and with your pinky reach up to the seventh fret on the third string from the bottom this might this might seem like you're not gonna be able to do it if that stretch if it's just not happening if you can not get your pinky to the seventh fret take your thumb and bring it down to the back of the neck look at this thumbs up here oh my poor pinky can't do it if I bring my thumb back here oh my fingers just magically open up and I throw my pick on the ground and all is right with the world let's play just that little teeny little part we just did we have middle finger fifth fret on the top ring finger was on standby we go like this we go one two three one two ring finger top string pinky on the seventh fret of the third string from the bottom I don't think I explained that last part very well you got this part right fifth fret open open then I think you have the next part fifth fret open fifth fret with the ring finger then you just go top string on the fifth fret then pinky on the seventh fret of the third string from the bottom let's play that part one more time nice and nice and slow we're doing it slow one two here we go and one two three one two three one two you get to relax your middle finger pointer finger plays fourth fret on the top string do the first three notes of the picking pattern again one two three keep your pinky on that seventh fret you're gonna do top string third string scooch your pinky up to the eighth fret of this third string from the bottom oh energy just got sapped out of the room did you feel that did you feel when I read when I I just I I I I I I remember there were two other sections of the song and I was just like man there's gonna be a there's gonna be this is gonna be a great time I'm so excited to share this experience with you where okay we were at four with a pointer open seven back up to the top string four open then pinky goes up to eight so it's quite a stretch you can handle it then back up to four on the top relax your pinky and just play the third string from the bottom open so here's here's what we just did we did four and seven four and eight four open this whole entire time our picking pattern has not changed at all we're going top string third string from the top third string from the bottom plucking up let's flip let's play it from this part do you remember the part with the two sevens where we went seven oh zero seven seven zero seven seven you remember that part no great let's do it from there one two here we go and one two three one two three one two then pointer on the fifth fret and here we go that's right [Music] foreign [Music] I missed the string and it's all your fault it's all your fault now the video is never gonna get done there's oatmeal everywhere okay great so after we play that part what we're gonna do is we're gonna go back to the part where it was just fifth fret on the top string and we went remember remember that part we went five open five no five oh shut up it went five open open five open five five seven remember that and then we did the four open seven we're gonna do all that again but then instead of going four open eight we're just gonna go like this four open open four open so we don't have to stretch up to eight the second time through okay let's play this hole in tie this is the intro to the song Let's play the entire intro all the way through medium speed you can see how it all fits together and then we can move on to the next part one two three four two three four then move it down one two then seven then five then top five seven seven eight and five five seven four that was it I can't believe I just did that I was like positive I was gonna mess it up but you know I mean not to brag I just I just played it perfectly so it was pretty cool I almost stopped the video just because I was like it's not gonna get any better than that that's the intro once the drums and stuff come in we're gonna oh do you know what I should I should say I should tell you something so I'm not sure if you've listened to this song before my guess is you probably have listened to this song at some point in your life it is it is quite fast is the fastest thing on the planet um and you're thinking I'm really supposed to hit all these specific strings while it's going a million miles an hour well here's the good news guys if you hit the wrong string every once in a while it still sounds pretty good all the open strings sound good so if you're you're trying to do this but if you go like this that still sounds okay right I mean that's that's practically what Mr Som York does in the song anyway all right well what we're gonna do now I always feel a little rude when I mispronounce people's names on purpose it's a mean thing to do you can go make fun of my name if you want um but be like nice though hmm did you know I'm not sure if you realize this but my first name is Stuart and the beginning of that word shares the same letters as the word stupid so you know that's pretty good you could use that um if you have any friends that are named Stuart you could call them stupid and that would be a funny joke also people that you don't know very well um like people at school if their name is Stuart you could call them you could just call him stupid they or or if their name isn't Stuart you can just go around calling people stupid okay hi my name is stupid uh you can leave a comment I don't know I don't know what you're gonna comment about don't call me stupid that would be mean um but you could like the video you could subscribe to the channel all right let's get let's keep going here so once the drums come in it's the same exact chords over here with the left hand but the right hand just kind of starts strumming it's going let's see what the next part sounds like [Music] something like that right so what's happening here is I'm just strumming down up down up down up down up down up down up but I'm accenting certain strums I'm when I say accenting here's what I mean on most of the strums I'm just trying to hit the top string if I hit the top two or three strings it's all good but I'm aiming for the top string still going down up down up but on certain strums I'm hitting all the strings here's what's happening I'm going soft soft loud soft soft loud soft loud so it ends up going down up down up down up down up guys it follows that same Rhythm of the picking we were doing we were going down down up down down up down up now we're going soft stuff loud soft loud soft loud so you know there's that let's let's just do the first two chords so you can practice the strumming with me nice and slow and one two here we go [Music] what are you doing [Music] that was weird which has happened okay that's the that part of the song that's what he's going I don't know is he singing there that's when the drums come in then we get to the verse of the song guys I have seen a lot of people play it where they're over here and they're going [Music] I but do you know what though the thing is that's not how Dom York plays it he's up here guys he's up here here's what's gonna happen you're gonna play the 12th fret this is the part where it goes [Music] my caller's messed up I should probably button one more of these buttons yeah look better unbuttoned all right so here's what's happening you're gonna you're gonna strike you're gonna play the 12th fret on the top string we're gonna aim for that top string but if you hit a few more strings that's great we're gonna strum down on that then you're gonna strum down up so it's down down up great then you're gonna slide your finger to the ninth fret you're gonna strum down then immediately after that put your pointer finger on the seventh fret of the third string from the top and strum up so that was 12 down up nine up on that note right there see what I'm doing let's do that again one two here we go down down up down up then strum down aiming for the top string get rid of your pointer finger and strum okay down down up down let's do that two times guys one two play it with me and down down up nine seven down up one two one more time and down down up nine and confusing I know you're doing great if that stretches too much you can use your ring finger for that ninth fret I just like using my middle finger just on that kind of guy middle finger kind of guy I'm really not a middle finger kind of guy when you say it like that okay this next part's not too bad we just played up without the pointer finger then in the same position you're gonna strum pump down up so now now we've got this 12 down up nine up up now put your pointer finger on the seventh fret of the third string from the top again strum down then get rid of your pointer finger and strum up down up down up so now we've got 12 down up nine up foreign add some more notes right I mean I don't know I don't know what you're waiting for reach down with your pointer finger to the seventh fret on the third string from the bottom so strum down on this chord then immediately slide your pointer finger up to the eighth fret strum up play the top string get rid of your pointer finger and strum up so that was like this it was [Music] a seven eight and open seven eight and open would you play just those four strums with me one two here we go and seven eight and open here we go and seven eight and open spark kind of sucks right let's take it from the beginning of the this whole section I guess it's the verse so taking it from the 12th fret one two three four twelve down up nine and up down up down I added in the next part without telling you it was a Secret Surprise let's do that one more time this time I won't add in The Secret Surprise and I'll play it a little slower what Joe here we go and twelve down up nine up open up down up I think you did great I feel like I feel like this part's confusing I I know you're at jonesing for the next part but I feel like we gotta do it one more time one two here we go and twelve down up nine and up and open okay right after we just did seven eight I'm sorry seven eight and open then pointer finger goes to seventh fret on the third string from the top again strum up then play the top string down and then get rid of your pointer finger and strum up so now that was [Music] okay that's the whole first section of the verse there's two parts to the verse this is the hard section now we get through the easy section but first we have to play the hard section all the way through what two three four and twelve down up nine [Music] oh and then after that you're gonna strum up down who cares that part's easy you just fill in the blank you're like I don't I none of this easy I don't know where I am I don't even know who I am anymore I know you guys you gotta do it a million times I'm just I'm just gonna I'm not gonna get into a whole spiel about practicing but just yeah the first like two weeks you play it it's not gonna sound very good don't even do this part the first week just practice the first part okay the first part sounds great you've been working on that I can tell you're also looking thin you've been getting in really good shape with your diet and exercise routine I can tell ah now we get to do the easy part of the verse goes like this you're gonna put your pointer middle uh which uh this one you're gonna put your middle finger on the fifth fret of the top string you're also going to mute the second string from the top with your middle finger and then ring finger is going to play fifth fret on the third string from the top guys something I have not mentioned but I'm going to mention now for this entire song this part of my hand I guess it's my palm I don't know it's the playground callous part of your hand it's just gonna touch the bottom string to mute it if you don't mute the bottom string and it's open that's okay but for me this part of my hand is just kind of resting on that bottom string the entire time so a little uh thing there for okay on the fifth fret you're gonna strum down down up then immediately slide your fingers over to the fourth fret and strum down down up so that was like down down up down down up then move back to five strum up is that right right yeah it's right you're gonna strum up on five and then immediately slide your fingers to two and strum down on two so it went a little something like this five down four down up five two here we go five down a four down up five two three four five down up four down up five two on the two after you just drum down then you're gonna strum down down up again so that whole thing sounds like this down down four down up five two down down up okay great we're doing great next part next part gets a little rhythmic get ready strung the twos again going down then slide up to four don't re-strum on the four just strum and slide then go back to the two and strum down again so that's once you get back to the tune you strum down then you're gonna strum down down up yet again so that was downside down down and then it's probably something else happens why is someone texting me how's recording it's going it's going fine it's going fine so we just slid up to four then we went back to two and played down down down up right or something like that so then you're gonna just go back to four strum up on four slide down to two and then strum down down up on the two and that was awful this is terrible let's just play this whole part slowly starting from the five one two nice and slow m [Music] I don't know that's something like that then we do then we do basically the same thing but instead of starting with five and going to four we're doing seven five five seven two two so so this look we're going seven down up five down up seven two two look obviously I don't really know this part that well like I thought I did I this is accurate but I just I I don't have the patience for your crap today okay that's what I'm trying to say here so just just go like this just go and it's gonna be fine and go like this do you know that part perfectly now let's learn the bridge the little like breakdown instrumental Bridge part this part I don't think I'm playing it with the exact same fingerings that Tom York is playing in it's the same notes but I think I'm playing it slightly differently this part's easy don't worry we're almost done it goes like this goes [Music] it's very fun so here's what's happening it's all in the top two strings I'm just strumming down up down up down up down up on the top two strings if you hit the third string fourth string from the top no big deal you're gonna go like this first just play the top string open then you're gonna put your ring finger on the fourth fret of the second string from the top we're gonna hit the top two strings and strum down up so it's top down up then go to the second fret on the second string from the top strum down then go back to the fourth string struck back to the fourth fret idiot we were never on the fourth string strum up so that was top four four two four then down up on the fifth fret of the second string from the top then down up on the seventh fret of the second string from the top down up on the ninth fret of the second string from the top down up on the 12th fret of the second string from the top down up on the 14th fret of the second string from the top let's see if that was accurate I don't actually know well what I just did there wasn't accurate but I think what I told you is accurate let's do it slower one two three four foreign look I've been dreading doing this video for like three weeks because Radiohead songs are hard and and and my guitar is Out Of Tune in here but is small so whatever foreign"
