    "Transcript": "[Music] thank you Evergreen by Richie Mitch and the coal miners I know anything about this band I don't know who Richie Mitch is I don't even know who the coal miners are for being completely honest but here's what I do know you gotta have a guitar in standard tuning and you must put a capo on the third fret I like you know what I use a Kaiser Capo there's a link in the description and go get yourself a nice old Kaiser mcapo using the affiliate links for me self-conscious about saying that so I had to mispronounce links that was my way of dealing with it moving on my name is Stuart welcome to guitar lessons with Stuart cape on the third fret Frets make sure it's nice and snug on there at this point in time you're going to play an F chord there are myth chord that I believe they use in the user song in the recording ring finger is going to be on the third fret of the second string from the top pinky third fret on the third string from the top middle finger second fret on the third string from the bottom pointer finger first fret on the second string from the bottom now I use my thumb to mute the top string if you feel like it would be a comfortable thing for you to do you could have your thumb play the first fret on the top string I usually don't with this song I don't think it's necessary and uh you know I can do it but just kind of like to move the top string I like the sound of it bottom string of the guitar this High E string some people like to have their pointer fingers smashed down onto the bottom two strings I think that's a pain in the butt so what I do is I just have my pointer finger mute the bottom string and if we're being 100 perfectly honest for being transparent am I being clear crystal what's that from is that from Breaking Bad I don't remember anyway uh if you have the on the F chord and for this song If you have the bottom string open it still sounds pretty good so that's my feeling about that F chord let's learn the strumming pattern for the beginning for the beginning we would like the strumming to be muted it's got that cool muted sound so here's what I do I take this part of my hand side of my palm and I just very lightly touch the strings right here oh you can see my computer it's one of those you can see my computer days I just have the side of my palm touch the strings right there and then when I strum I try to keep my wrist as loosey-goosey as possible but I just touch the strings if it's like this if you're too far this way doesn't sound like anything if you're too far this way can't hear the muting you want to be right right there you see where my hand is look look you get his little sneak peek ah there's no way I can get a good angle so we've got our palm muting going if you don't like the palm muting don't do it I don't care and here's the strumming we're gonna go one two three one two three that's wasn't helpful at all you strum down a bunch of times you strum down eight times one two three four five six seven eight and then right after that eighth one I do a quick little strum up so I'm going one two four five six seven eight wait that wasn't right I don't know how to count I don't know how to count one two three four five six seven eight and one two three four five six seven eight out one two three four five six seven eight what a joke um and then also what I like to do is every third strum I put a little Accent on it I go one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one [Music] feel like this is one of the most scattered starts I've ever had but I think we get it we all understand what's Happening Here [Music] you're gonna do that pattern once on the f one two three four five six down down then you go to an A minor chord the way you do a minor top string is going to be muted with your thumb still second string from the top open put your middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the top ring finger on the second fret of the third string from the bottom pointer finger on the first fret of the second to bottom string a minor chord when you switch from the F to the a minor you get to keep your pointer finger in the exact same spot look at this look at this boom bang boom pointer finger does not move if you lift up your pointer finger and start from scratch it's going to take you so much longer so we're going F a minor at this point in time we're going to play a C the version of C we're gonna play is a c over G here's what it is you've got your a minor chord all ready to go lift up your ring finger but keep your pointer finger and middle finger in the same spots put your ring finger on the third fret of the top string and then your pinky right below it on the third fret of the second string from the bottom we're gonna do that same strumming pattern but we're gonna do it twice on this C over G chord so watch this C over G then again that's the intro the intro is just one guitar doing that two times then we get into the big old straw movie into the official song part of the song we're gonna play the exact same chords but now the strumming is gonna change first of all We're Not Gonna Palm mute anymore we are done palm muting get your F chord all ready to go our strumming is now going to be like this instead of going down down down down down down down down down up down down down down down down down down up we are now going to go down down up down up down down up down up down down I know it's confusing let's take it step by step starts off you go down great easy peasy lemon squeezy would you please go down down up down up down so let's just say it first just repeat after me down down up down up down now let's play it here we go down down up down up down one more time and GI Joe and down down up down up down great down down up down up down down up down up down down down up down up down down up down up down and down down up down up down down up down up down that's wrong I did it no that's right I'm smart one two here we go down down up down up down down up down up down again down down up down up down down up down up down all that's left is one more down up like this down down up down up down down up down up down up nope what happened what's happened to me like this down up down up down down up down up down down up very confusing nice and slow play along with me on the F chord one two here we go down down up down up down down up down up down down up now let's do it two times in a row but this time we're gonna do it once on the F then we'll do it once on the a minor deal one two three four down down up down up down down up down up down down down down up down up down down up down up down down up we did it do it fast let's do it fast now what you're gonna notice is we do it fast is it gets hard to switch from one chord to the next so on the last strum up you lift up your fingers getting ready to switch to the next chord so if we do it kind of slow it's like down down up down up down down up down down down left down down up down up down down up down up down down left down down up like that like that and then we do it faster let's try it try it fast with me two here we go down down sorry I forgot what corbs next but that's not all so we do that once on the F one's on the a minor twice on the C over G with that new strumming but here's one more little wrinkle for the F chord and the a minor chord halfway through that strumming pattern you're gonna lift up your middle finger so it's gonna be on the F we're going down down up down up down down up down up down lift it up my middle finger for the a minor it's down down up down up down down up down up down when we do it fast it goes like a Swatch this is the greatest it goes [Music] he is just normal just normal we're gonna do that we're gonna play that new strumming pattern with the little lifty up middle finger thing two times then the vocals come in the singing starts and we do it another two times so so far we've got two times with the palm muting then we do it two times with the new strumming no singing two times with the new strumming with singing we're gonna call that the verse then we're gonna get to the chorus the chorus is almost exactly the same a little bit different we've got the F chord but then don't switch to the a minor just start doing the F again so we go down down up down up down down down up but then after that last down up down up on the F chord you're gonna take that entire chord and move it one two Frets over now we have a G chord like that that's a G chord so watch this F down up down up down down up down down up and down up down up down up down see that right there and this takes us right to an A minor chord which we do twice so watch this when we get to the chorus it goes like this it only does that one single solitary time then we just do the F chord twice [Music] and then to the C chord when I went from the F to the C notice these three fingers all move together as one unit pointer finger stays in the same spot that goes like that the very end of the song is we just do the F twice then the C twice then we do F twice and then one strum of c and the song is over let's play the whole thing all the way through because it's so short we'll do it medium speed almost full speed not quite one and two and from the top and [Music] and repeat that how's your palm meeting going [Music] then the new strumming do it again then the singing starts then we get to the chorus [Music] here comes the ending almost done it's hard to talk and play it at the same time so much strumming so anyway I messed up I messed up and I hope you won't hold it against me Evergreen bye Richie Mitch and the coal miners my name's Stuart welcome to guitar lessons with Stuart I'm standing at the end now why do I say welcome at the end it doesn't make any sense"
