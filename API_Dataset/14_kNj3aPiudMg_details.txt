    "Transcript": "wow did you like my first video i'm assuming so because you clicked on my second thanks for giving me a second chance or maybe you just stumbled across this video in which case hi my name is ellen and i make guitar tutorials right here on youtube and welcome to my beginner series make sure if you haven't seen the first episode to click right here to start from the beginning so you don't miss a thing so let's grab our guitars and get started in the first episode we covered the basics of how to tune your guitar but if you need more explanation click on this video i have right here which goes into super detail on how to do it today i'm going to teach you another chord which you can use to unlock even more songs to play by the end of this video so make sure to stay tuned to see what those are do you want to know the secret ingredient to what will help you become a better guitar player come closer [Music] wait wait come back you can also use this guy this is going to be your new practice buddy the metronome now what i have in my hand is a physical metronome but there are plenty of free apps you can download as well isn't technology great i'll link some of my favorites below so make sure to click over in that description box so what is it basically it's a device that clicks to the beat so that it helps you keep time kind of like how you might tap your foot to a song while you're listening to it the most useful part is that you can choose what speed you want to go and this is the secret ingredient to what's going to help you learn guitar faster so first of all let's cover how a metronome works once you turn it on you can adjust the speed of the clicking by either increasing or decreasing the number that's displaying so remember in our first episode we practiced going from the g to c add nine chords and we were strumming down four times for each chord now if you need a refresher or want more practice on that make sure to visit my first episode again all right so today we're going to add a brand new chord that's pretty easy to transition to but first let's start with our g chord that we learned last time now remember to switch to your next chord which is c add 9 you just want to take these two fingers and move them down one string each so now we have our c add 9 chord awesome and so today's new chord we're going to learn is super simple all you have to do is take off your middle finger and then move your index finger down one more string okay so it sounds like this and something you'll notice is i'm not playing these top two strings we're only strumming the bottom four [Music] this is our d suspended chord or dsus4 chord for short it's basically just a variation of a d chord and so now you can see when we're switching between our c add 9 and our dsus4 it's a super easy transition all we have to do is take off your middle finger and move your first finger down so now let's go ahead and practice this new dsus4 chord a little bit more but with our metronome set to 50 beats per minute so now what we want to do is keep that four down strum pattern just like last time except now we're going to be strumming to the beat of the metronome like this one and two and ready go down down down great so what we just played is called a measure in music lots of popular songs today use four beats in one measure just like how we just did it so now let's go ahead and try to transition between our c add 9 and our new dsus4 chord but again we're gonna do this to the beat of the metronome here i'll show you one and two and ready go c two three four switch to d two three four back to c two three four back to d two three four hop in try this with me now back to d two three four work on those transitions and concentrate on playing to the beat of the metronome so how did that go if you found it a little bit too difficult no worries that just means that 50 beats per minute is a little bit too fast for you right now and that's fine because that's what our metronome is for i found over the years that using a metronome really helps to push you just a little bit to challenge you but not so much that it overwhelms you as long as you choose the right speed so how do you know what the right speed is for you well i like to think about it in three little stages at the first stage is when your metronome is too slow so this means that you're hitting every single one of those beats right on the beat super easy for you you might even feel yourself getting a little bored because you're not getting challenged at all it's kind of like you're learning to drive but all you can do is drive around in circles not productive not challenging the second stage is when your metronome is too fast so you might be noticing that when you're practicing you're missing almost every single beat you're getting really frustrated and you might even be thinking about quitting because you're so frustrated this is because you might be jumping too far ahead and you haven't developed the muscle memory yet it's kind of like a beginner driver trying to merge onto a busy highway at 80 miles per hour for the very first time it's way too much too fast not productive too challenging terrifying actually the third stage is when your metronome is just right that means when you're practicing you're hitting most of the beats and you might miss a few every now and then this is kind of like the sweet spot you should aim to practice in because it's not so easy that you don't feel challenged but it's also not so hard that you feel like quitting so think about a new driver practicing driving in a neighborhood there are some challenges like having to watch out for some kids playing in the street or maybe your neighbor's dog getting loose but it's nothing you can't handle so now that you know how to use a metronome go ahead and pause the video to find your just right speed and then once you find it use it to practice through the three chords that we've already learned in this series and remember that even though we learned them in this order that doesn't mean you're always going to be playing them in this order so pause on this next screen and practice your transitions with your metronome for all of the chord progressions i have listed [Music] welcome back did you actually pause and practice if not it's not too late make sure you feel comfortable with those transitions listed on the previous screen because now we're gonna kick it up a notch so far we've been practicing playing four down strums for every chord like i said in the last video this is a great strumming pattern to start with and now i get to show you how we can dress it up without changing a thing how you ask we're going to use our left hand to change chords more frequently while our right hand stays exactly the same let's take this for example right now i have four down strums on screen in the first video we practice this with our g chord one two three and we practice switching to our c chord one two three four today we added our d chord one two three four now i want to challenge you and instead of staying on the same chords for all four of these down strums i want you to try and switch chords throughout it so we have our g chord on the first two down strums and our c add nine chord on the last two like this [Music] okay your turn let's try it together one two ready go g g c c awesome okay now let's try this one as you can see we've got c add nine for our first two down strums and then we go to d sus4 for our last two one two ready go [Music] great job okay how about this one we've got g on our first two and then d sus4 on our last two you ready one two ready go [Music] if any of this is too difficult for you to keep up with right now make sure to go back to this time and pause the screen to practice these transitions at your own tempo okay now that you get the idea let's try something harder let's try this one to the beat of the metronome it should sound like this [Music] how did you do these are getting trickier because now we're practicing between all three chords let's try this one [Music] great job okay let's just try one more awesome again if any of this is too hard for you to keep up with right now it's probably because you're not used to those transitions yet so make sure to go back to this time and pause and practice once you're comfortable with making those transitions you can use your metronome to practice speeding it up until you can reach 70 beats per minute which is what we'll be using for the last part of this video so now that you know we can sometimes switch cords inside a strumming pattern i'm going to put a whole series of measures on screen for you to try one two ready go [Music] i don't know about you [Music] me [Music] will be all right [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] i fell into [Music] keep on turning [Music] me home to see if i can singing [Music] once again [Music] the skies [Music] thanks so much for making it to the end of the video i'm so proud of you for playing even more songs and i hope that you see the progress you're making with your guitar if you liked this video
