    "Transcript": "let's get right into it with the first part which is the part played in the intro and the verse remember like all my videos lyrics with chords on top of them and strumming patterns cover this song or in the description below this video so open that and you can use that to fall along with this video alright so grab your tart and let's get started with learning the first part any three complete beginner you're probably gonna want to start off with my free intro to guitar crash course right here and then come back to this tutorial once you've done that [Music] so grab an e-minor let's try that out [Music] we've got all down strums and it's gonna be on the one the end of two and the four so one two and three four one two and three four now you're going to do is play the strong pattern once on each chord before switching let's try it all together [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they in the pre-course we're going to use the same strumming pattern from the verse but we're just going to switch up the chords a little bit so this time we've got a minor [Music] and we're gonna play that for twice as long then we're gonna go to a G and then we're gonna end on a D and otherwise we've already been through everything so it's pretty simple so let's try that one out [Music] [Applause] [Music] and finally we're gonna move in the last part we need to play this entire song the chorus if you're enjoying this video so far please hit that thumbs up button and let me know in the comments below it really does make more of a difference than you think and make sure to subscribe if you want the fastest way to learn your favorite songs and improve your guitar [Music] let's try the strumming pattern for this section [Music] one two three and four and one two three and four and one two three and four and one two three and four and to pause the video and try that out a few times on your own and like always once you've got the strumming pattern down let's try adding in the courts now the one thing to watch out for here is that the first three chords G E minor and a minor are played for two run throughs of the strumming pattern instead of one the C and D are just played for one so watch out for that and let's try it [Music] [Applause] so then the end of the course is going to be slightly different we're going to go back to our verse chord progression and we're just gonna play each of them for four beats each so it's really simple [Music] and if you can play those parts you can play the entire song one final note is if you want to play along with the actual recorded version of song you need to put your capo on the first fret and play everything else the exact same I like to play it without a capo though because first off a lot of you guys don't have a capo and the second thing is that without the capo you just sing the song a little bit lower which is easier for most people especially guys but if you want to play along with the actual song you are gonna need that capo and I've got to link to my favorite one in the description below if you want to check that out once you practice all those guitar parts a few times let's bring it all together to try it out in a full song play through I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you in the next 5 min ago tireless [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you you"
