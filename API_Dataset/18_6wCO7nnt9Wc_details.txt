    "Transcript": "foreign [Music] ER by The Cranberries guys I'm gonna I I really like the Cranberries I just I just really like them they I said offensive if I say they reminded me of The Smiths I feel like they're like calling to Smith's like a 90s version of The Smiths well I guess we'll learn it so standard tuning normal guitar is pretty easy it's guys if you're a beginner this song is a nice one if you're not a beginner this song is a nice one just a nice song and a nice song about lingering you need a d chord guys put your middle finger on the second fret of the bottom string put your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom put your pointer finger on the second fret of the third string from the bottom at this point in time you're actually gonna lift up your pointer finger we don't want that one just yet but have it on standby ready to go you're gonna play the bottom three strings one at a time look you play the third from the bottom then you play second from the bottom then you play the bottom one but I recommend you pluck up on the bottom one so it goes boom boom pow let's do that a couple times in a row let's go boom boom pow boom boom pow there's a little Gap and before you started over there's a tiny little pause we go like that guys we're gonna do it four times in a row one two here we go [Music] Paul if you'll think back a moment you think with your ears right if you if you remember I told you your pointer finger had to be on standby ready to go at this point after you play that four times your pointer finger is gonna go back to its spot on the second fret of the third string from the bottom and then you're gonna do the exact same thing one two three introduction to the song we just do this one we're gonna I look I tried to count how many times they do this I like three times I put on the song I played along with it was counting along I was like all right they do it once they do it twice they do it three times I wonder about the stuff with the things and I wonder what the song is about oh crap I forgot to count I did that three times and so I do three what is what is happening guys they do it a bunch of times maybe eight I don't know let's do it let's what do you say we do that whole thing twice together right now okay those times Spanish for two surprised you didn't know that one two here we go switch and pointer and pull it off oh pointer again that face I just made least favorite face anytime I see anyone on a TV show in a movie in real life making that face I think to myself well that's a stupid face they should stop making it and there here I am making it guys there's I lied to you I said that was the intro there's actually one more spot to the intro after we do that 27 000 times you go like this all three fingers on the second fret of the bottom three strings so like second fret second fret second fret to strum the bottom three strings then get rid of your ring finger get rid of the finger on the bottom and then strum that so that was it's debatable I'm gonna that could be I'm gonna say this is sort of like a D major seven chord but it doesn't actually sound wait this was thinking so it doesn't actually sound like a D major seven chord do you hear all this racket outside listen okay it's not very loud I might be overreacting slightly I think this isn't what I'm trying to say is I believe this is an A6 chord so look we go and then this is a regular a chord there but it's a weird vert don't forget I said that you don't need to know the names of these chords shop look you do that then at this point I totally remember what you do oh you go to a c go to a c so that's pointer finger first fret second string from the bottom middle finger second fret third string from the top we skipped a string right there ring finger third the racket is back stopped in ring finger third fret second string from the top this is a c chord you're gonna strum that then you're gonna get rid of your pointer finger that becomes a C Major seven it's a lot of stuff but don't worry I'm gonna tie it all together it's gonna make perfect sense then we go to a g what do you know about G oh is it this middle finger third fret on the top pointer finger second fret second string from the top ring finger is on the third fret of the second string from the bottom and Pinky is right below that on the third fret of the bottom string you're gonna strum that then get rid of your ring finger but that's actually kind of hard to lift up your ring finger if you want you can just lift up your ring finger or get rid of your pinky and move your ring finger on there from that those are both G chords but they switch they go so that big confusing part that I just showed you is not actually that bad I just made it oh so much more harder than it more harder oh I can't believe I said that I made it much harder than I needed to I feel like I should put this part at the end because it's not very intriguing at the beginning here we go remember that and then you wait a few beats then then wait a few more beats then so that means the entire intro is you go like this a whole bunch of times and then you go like this one two three four and a one two three four a one two and then the actual song starts guys my name is Stuart welcome to guitar lessons with Stuart this is Langer by The Cranberries okay so I have a question I know when people say like Let It linger like I know it's a reference to this song but what do they mean by that I'm an old man I don't know what it means when people say Let It linger would you explain it in the comments and only if it's nice though not if it's mean and not if it's gross what does it mean to let things linger you guys I feel like it's gonna be gross all right the verse to the song should we learn the verse great news the verse in the chorus are exactly the same goes like this foreign [Music] okay so I'm gonna chill out I keep making just weird noises guys hi okay D chord we already went over the D it was starting from the bottom you go second fret then third fret then second fret now here's the thing about the D chord guys I didn't tell you about this earlier you must mute the top string with your thumb you just gotta you just gotta if you if you're not that's something you just take your thumb you bring it up over the top you don't even have to wrap your thumb around you just need to like smush it down see I'm just smooshing it down so that the fleshy smushiness of my thumb touches the top string and that's what lingering is when you smush your thumb on this dick if you want if you want you can mute the top two strings sometimes I find myself doing but you don't need to you only need to be the top one on this D chord you're going to strum like this you're gonna go down down up down [Music] what are you kidding me I have to memorize that whole thing look play just the first part of it with me we're just gonna go down down up down down up two here we go down down up down down up one two one more time down down up down down up highlight this is the last time down down up down down up let's add the next part now now we're gonna go down down up down down up up down down down down up down down up up down down hey down down up down down up up down down just the people then back to me just the dogs bark bark yeah just the cows hey the cats meow meow meow meow this is the last one I promise meow meow meow hey so helpful my name is Stuart like And subscribe did I say that already oh guys it's been a long day already it is currently 1103 a.m in the morning I've got a banjo over here there's a little rubber duck so many things are happening let's proceed with the song I think we know that's oh there's more of the strumming okay look down down up down down up up down down down up that's down up at the end that's the one that during that down up that really is just buying us time to switch to the next chord what's the next chord you ask great question the next chord is an A6 chord an A6 chord is sort of like a bar chord but I promise it's like one of the easiest bar chords you're ever gonna have to do here's what you do your pointer finger plays the second fret on the third string from the top the tip of your finger plays that second fret there but then you take the rest of your senior singer your finger linger and you smash it down onto the bottom four strings on the second fret you can use your middle finger to help if you really don't want to do this you may use four fingers and do it like that but I'm telling you that's just gonna be harder like you can try it if you like it this way more great but I don't think you're going to I just use pointer finger smash down those four and then you know it'd be great if you you could mute the top string with your thumb but it's not you don't have to and then you're gonna do the same strumming on this chord down down up down up um I should also mention we're going to do this strumming pattern two times on each chord so if we just do the D and the A6 it goes like this one two three four down down up down up Dig Down [Music] down up up down down up down down up down down up up down down up down down up down down up up down down oink oink okay so at this point in time I'm going to tell you that over the D chord there's a little secret little surprise I'm going to show you but I'm not going to show you just yet a little secret surprise that the Cranberries do on the D chord guys the next card is a c over g c over G is like this remember the C we did earlier it's like that but a little different take your ring finger put on the third fret of the top string pinky third fret second string from the top middle finger second fret third string from the top pointer finger first fret second string from the bottom this is a c over G it's called the C over G because it's a c chord with a G that's the lowest note if G is the lowest the rest of the chords above it C over G strumming sometimes he sneaks his pointer finger off for a second and then he goes like this you can do it if you want you don't need to he just does it occasionally one more chord g plain old regular G guys middle finger third fret top string pointer finger second fret second string from the top ring finger third fret second string from the bottom pinky third fret on the bottom string same strumming let's play all four chords all the way through two times on each chord for the strumming pattern everyone's gone I've got way too much energy today let's just play one let's do a slow let's do slow and easy let's Let It linger George and [Applause] bendy A6 over G and the g I know what you're thinking you're thinking Stuart I did okay but I wasn't great at switching the chords also another thing I'm not convinced that I did the strumming exactly right each time yeah you know what the truth is this strumming pattern is more kind of a it's like a guideline it's a suggestion okay I recommend you do this drumming it's it's what the guy does most of the time but it's not what he does 100 of the time you can ad-lib a little bit you can make stuff up a little bit however I highly recommend you stick to this strumming at you try to get the strumming just right don't go well I'm gonna do something else because it's easier try to do this one and then if it goes a little why am I doing this why am I going off on this whole thing all I needed to say was get the strawberry as close as you can doesn't need to be perfect great perfect that's the intro no I just can I show you something see this pic normal pick right look look look look look look foreign guys this is a ten dollar pay there's a ten dollar guitar pick sounds fine sounds like shinier I like this one I like the dark I like this one more and that's how you play Linger by The Cranberries I'm gonna use a ten dollar one why not all right so the intro is this thing and then we went and then and then uh and then we started our strumming they do that strumming with those chords for the verse they do it for the chorus a bunch of times for the verse bunch of times for the chorus back to the verse back to the chorus back to the prank bang we have to learn uh that little secret surprise about the D I told you about here's all it is on the D to get the true Cranberries Linger sound you have to go like this so all that is is we go down down up down down then when we strum up right there you have to pull your middle finger off which changes it into a d sus2 chords you guys let's practice that together down down up down down oh oh then you have to put it right back down for the next drum one two three four [Music] I think that's how he does it what does he do it right there well shoot the whole video is ruined you lift up your middle finger that's the secret surprise and then there's the outro and they find it when they're done singing they're done with the song you go back to the intro but with a tiny little difference the picking's a little different instead of going we're going to go [Music] so here's what that is you got your same two these two chords the same ones we did before you go third from the bottom second from the bottom then the bottom no that was a that was a that was a gosh darn lie you guys you go third from the bottom then you go to the very bottom then you go second from the bottom and then third from the bottom so it's I'm plucking down up up down and then you do again up up down so then you go third from the bottom bottom and you start the whole thing over again so it's [Music] again then add your finger foreign foreign [Music]"
