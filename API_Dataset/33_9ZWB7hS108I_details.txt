    "Transcript": "[Music] Hi! Steve Stine from GuitarZoom.com . And what \nI'd like to do is give you some songs that you   could play with three chords. And not only using \nthe same three chords but using them in the same   order just to make things easy. One of the most \nimportant things I try and teach students is   that along your journey of learning how to play \nguitar and practicing various techniques and all   these sorts of things you should be doing \ntwo things number one trying to make it as   fun and engaging as possible for you so every \nday when you want to practice again you don't   just go oh no i don't want to do this right and \nthe second thing is is just to keep inspired a   lot of times when we play along with songs it \ncan be fun for us and it makes us motivated to   want to keep going so what i did here was i chose \nthree different songs that i'm going to show you   that use the three chords d c and g in various \ndifferent ways but they're using those same three   chords in the same order over and over and \nover so before i get started with the songs   i want to show you a little bit about chords if \nyou don't know these or if you have some questions   and if you already know these three chords you \ncan certainly fast forward just a little bit   and get to the songs so first thing i want to \ntalk about is some variety of things that we   can do when we're learning how to play chords for \ninstance your c might be a little bit different   than my c chord or your g chord might be a little \nbit different and i don't want to worry about that   because we all play things a little \nbit differently like for instance g   if we really thought about it g the g chord across \nthe entire guitar can be played all kinds of   different ways um so i don't want to worry about \nwhether or not there's seven different ways of   playing a g chord i want you to focus on what \nit is that you're using and if you don't know a   g chord i'm going to give you some suggestions \nokay that sort of thing so let's start with d   and just look at this first chord here okay so \nd chord is played by uh strumming the bottom   four strings and what we're gonna do is put \nour first finger on the third string second   fret we're gonna put our middle finger on the \nfirst string second fret and we're gonna put   the third finger on the second string third \nfret and we're going to strum the bottom four   now if you strum a few too many don't worry \nabout it you're just trying to hit the bottom   four that's really what you're targeting for now c \nis a chord that when it comes up sometimes people   play it differently the standard c generally is \ntaught like this okay and this is fine there's   nothing wrong with this c you could put your \nfirst finger on the second string first fret   you can put your middle finger on the fourth \nstring second fret and your third finger   on the fifth string third fret and then \nyou would strum the bottom five [Music]   now if you're just learning how to play you might \nplay like an easy c where you're just using your   first finger on the second string right there and \nyou're just strumming the bottom three strings   and something like that would be just fine and \nthen we've got our full c like this that we could   do and again there's lots of different variations \nof c and then we've got our g chord now g you'll   see i'm playing g with four fingers oftentimes \nyou'll see people play with three fingers or   they'll just play the first string like \nthis so let's talk about that for a second   the way i'm playing g is going to be like this \ni'm going to put my first finger on the fifth   string second fret i'm going to put my middle \nfinger on the sixth string third fret i'm going   to put my third finger on the second string third \nfret and my pinky on the first string third fret   okay now what i want to do is throw you a little \nloop though if you've never done this before i   want to show you how to play what's called \na c add 9 which is a little different than   the normal c chord but we use it a lot \nin popular music you know in blues and   acoustic and you know rock and different \nthings like that and basically what you   can do is instead of having to go from this g \nchord right here and flip over to this c chord   what you can do is just keep this g as it \nis and then what you do is you just drop   these two fingers down one string so you're \ngoing from g like this [Music] to c like this   and then when you want to go to your d chord \nyou can leave your third finger where it is and   use that as kind of a a brace to switch over \nto your d chord [Music] okay so we have g c   and d now again if you play those a little \ndifferently than that don't worry about it   so that's what i'm going to be using now the \norder we're going to be using these chords is   going to be this we're going to go from d to c to \ng that's all the seven songs we're going to talk   about that's all we're doing is moving from d to c \nto g so if you play you know d to easy c to easy g   or something like that that's okay whatever works \nfor you so the first song we're gonna look at is   can't you see by marshall tucker okay if you've \nnever heard this before it's certainly worth   going and looking up and giving it a listen since \nyou're probably on or near youtube anyway right   so we've got d and what we're going to do is \nwe're just going to strum that d [Music] c g then back to d now i'm playing d for a measure c for a measure g \nfor a measure and then d for a measure so i have   to remember that i've got a d to begin with and \na d to end with now i'm going to play it again   but this time i'm going to use the c add 9 in \nthe middle like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] now either way of playing that c would sound \njust fine regardless of whether you go to a   you know a tablature or chord you know website \nand it says to play it a certain way what i want   you to constantly remind yourself is that it's \nokay to change things a little bit to make it   functional to make it easier to play instead of \nmaking everything into a a hard you know a chore   now again i'm not saying that you don't want \nto learn to play c this way or c this way   there's all kinds of different things you can \ndo depending on where you are in your journey   all i'm saying is try and remember the bottom line \nis here that we want to use songs to have some fun   right to make some sort of musical connection \nto songs that we enjoy to play along with   um you know the music however we like to so \nthat's what we're looking for so we've got d c g and back to d okay now we're going to take that same idea we're \ngoing to use it with a song called sweet child of   mine by guns and roses now the unfortunate part \nis if you try and play along with the actual song   guns and roses tunes down a half step so you'd \nhave to tune your guitar down a half step   if you don't know how to do that don't worry \num maybe you can sing it right you're more   than likely a better singer than i am so what \nyou can do is is just play the chords and sing   along now we can only play the verse of this \nsong we won't be able to do the chorus because   that's a little different but the verse of \nthe song would be this [Music] [Applause] [Music] it starts all over again four measures \nd c g d when it gets to the chorus it goes into a different part all right so we've \ngot the verse for that the next two songs that   we've got the rhythm changes just slightly we're \ngoing to be looking at fall uh fall to pieces by   velvet revolver and we're going to be looking at \nblue on black by kenny wayne shepard and basically   they're kind of the same thing let's look at blue \non black first so blue on black we're going to go [Music] now there's little things that \nkenny wayne shepard does we're   not worrying about all that we just want \nto play the song okay so we're going d   to c and g but what i want you to notice \nis that the the uh the c and the g chords   we're on those for much less time so \nwe're going d then we go to c then g d c g and you can see how we're running into that \ng right away which is a nice time to play this c   add 9 moving to that g because it's really fast to \njust move those two fingers again if you'd rather   play the full c to the full g that's okay but you \ncan see why it would be efficient to do it that   way okay fall to pieces is really the same thing \nunfortunately again slash being involved it's a   half step down again so if you try and play along \nwith fall to pieces you're gonna have to tune your   guitar down a half step or just sing it yourself \nand uh and don't okay so we have d [Music]   same thing same chord progression same \nkind of movement okay and then the last   three songs we've got are literally \nexactly the same thing in terms of   chords chord changes and really even just about \ntempo okay we've got um uh sweet home alabama   werewolves of london and all summer long uh \nsweet home alabama of course by leonard skynyrd   werewolves of london by warren zevon and all \nsummer long by kid rock so they all do d c g d c g so if we think about like uh \nsweet home alabama you've got this kind of riff going and again if you're far enough \nalong and you're playing you should learn how to   do that because it's really fun to do but if \nyou're not you're just going to play d c g d c g okay now we've got um warren zivan \nwe've got uh werewolves of london that that kind of thing again same thing it's d c g d c g [Music] and all summer long is literally \nexactly the same thing so if you learn how to   play those three chords d c and g with these seven \ndifferent songs even if you took out sweet child   of mine and you took out fall to pieces which \nare tuned differently and you just played these   other five you could play the entire song of \nall of these different songs just playing that   same thing now if you start learning how to move \nthose around and play them in a different order   that opens up you know hundreds of other different \nsongs that you can play as well and you learn how   to play a couple different chords so you can see \nhow you could keep learning more and more songs   by just learning one or two different chords \nbut i just wanted to show you something kind   of fun that you can do a couple of different ways \nthat you can play your chords and a few different   songs that you could look at that might be fun \nfor you so remember stay positive when you're   practicing stay on track you know don't get real \nfrustrated and then you know want to quit playing   figure out where your frustration is coming from \nand try and fix that and then come on back and   start practicing whatever it is you were working \non with these songs the goal is you know if your   first start if you're you're at a stage and you're \nand you're playing where you're just learning how   to play these chords don't worry so much about \nthe strumming and everything you could just go d   c g two three four d c g two three four right \nor you know strum half notes one two three   four one or quarter notes excuse \nme one two three four one two three   four like that okay if you were playing something \nlike blue on black then you'd have to go d d c g [Music]   you know minimize your strumming until \nyou develop those chords a bit more and   then when you're feeling better about \nit you can come back and strum some more   then you can keep adding in [Music] \nyou know more stuff and keep going   from there so anyway again stay positive \nkeep practicing and i'll talk to you soon"
