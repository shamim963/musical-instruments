    "Transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] bug collector by Haley Hendricks this is one of the most fun songs to play I need to tell you that the tuning for this song is weird we are going to go over the tuning and the Capo situation in just a moment but before we do that I would like to show you the main picking pattern that you're going to want to get comfortable with and then we will discuss the tuning why am I withholding the tuning from you I've oh okay we're just gonna get into the picking and then I'll show you the tuning in a second here's what I'd like you to do with your guitar they can be tuned however why am I doing it like this this is the worst idea look it's not that I don't want to tell you the tuning to this song it's that I want you to have something to practice before you have to commit to mutilating the tuning of your guitar because it's gonna take some time to tune it so I'm just gonna mute the strings over here I'm gonna show you the picking pattern and then you can decide when you to tune whenever you want to tune God why do you have to make such a big deal out of everything have your thumb resting on the a string the second string from the top like that have your pointer finger touching the bottom of the G string the third string from the bottom so it's like you can pinch those two strings together like that then I would like you to go ahead and play that a string with your thumb boom then have your pointer finger pluck up on the G string then have your thumb play the D string the third string from the top ping then have your middle finger play the B string the second string from the bottom pow it's just this four note pattern the rhythm is just totally consistent it goes boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom just a constant Rhythm like this foreign collector by Haley Hendricks to practice just picking pattern a little bit it's a variation of Travis picking which is a very common very beautiful um guitar finger picking pattern let's practice this four note pattern you can mute the strings or whatever who I don't care play for me the a string g string B string no I've flipped it up again let's practice that pattern slowly four times in a row we're gonna go like thumb pointer thumb middle one two here we go and thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb middle should we try it a little bit faster like I think we can do it I mean let's you know I can one two here we go and thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer thumb middle if you're in standard tuning just play any old chord I'm in weird tuning so I can't do any old chord but just get your like a minor your C or your whatever and just practice going [Music] do that while you're walking around the house bring your guitar to school or work with you and just play this pattern constantly I mean you know I'm kind of joking but play this pattern for like hours watch a movie a TV show read a book talk to your friend have a sip of your favorite coffee and just play this pattern the whole time did I say a sip or a cup I meant to say cup a sip wouldn't take for it okay we should probably move on to the song yes finally you have earned the privilege of knowing the tuning to the song so without the Capo on the tuning is like this top string is a the next one is also a then C sharp then e then G sharp and then this bottom string the high e we're actually not going to use it at all but I recommend tuning it down to C sharp because otherwise there is a decent chance it will break from the extra tension put on that string here's what I recommend you do you ready have no capo use your tuner app or clip-on tuner or whatever and I would like you to take that top string and tune it all the way to down to a it's going to be really loose it's going to be kind of tricky to get it in tune then you go down to the next string that one we actually shouldn't need to tune it the next one the D string you just tune it down a little bit to C sharp not too far the next one the G string you're going to tune that down quite a bit to get it down to e then the next one the B string we're going to tune that one down quite a bit to get it to G sharp and then finally the high e you tune that down quite a bit to get it to C sharp we are not tightening any of the strings if you try to tighten any strings it's going to be bad news after that put your Capo on the sixth fret but we're not done with doing it I didn't who said we were done we're not done with tuning the Capo is actually gonna stretch the strings Out Of Tune so you're gonna need to tune again when you have the Capo on but before we even get to that I have to tell you get your Capo can you see how close it is to the Fret uh how do I get my angle see that just right there see how the thread is like practically covered up by my Capo that's how we want it if your Capo is just right up against the Fret then it has way less likely to bend the strings All Out Of Tune very passionate about tuning so now that we have the cable on obviously we're going to tune to different notes with the cape on so the top string should be a D sharp or an E flat but probably D sharp so you just want to make sure that's right on that string is going to misbehave this whole time we're gonna have to tune it a few times the next one should now also be a D sharp the next one is a g the next one is an a sharp after that is a d mine drifted Out Of Tune a little bit there we go and then the last one should be a g we are finally done with the tuning although we're actually not because when you detune this much you have to kind of go through and tune it like three times to make sure all the tunes are at I call them Tunes to make sure all the strings are actually in tune finally we're done we're 27 minutes into the video and all we've done is tuned and learned one picking pattern let us begin first chord for the song put your ring finger on the fourth fret of the a string the second string from the top because we have the Capo that means it's one two three four we're counting up from the Capa so ring finger on the fourth fret of the second string from the top like that then your middle finger plays the third fret on the D string the third string from the top you see that right there doing the Spider-Man thing and I've got fourth fret third fret and you see my oh you see my little picture right there let me just lower this brightness it's embarrassing you guys could see my computer screen so we've got this right here this is our chord I don't know what it's called I could figure it out but I don't want to and then with this chord we're going to do our picking pattern that we did earlier do you remember the thumb pointer thumb middle if you skipped ahead because you couldn't stand all that talk about tuning I'll review it really quickly thumb plays the a string second string for the top pointer finger plays the G string third string from the bottom then the thumb plays the D string third from the top and then middle finger plays the B string second from the bottom let's play that pattern with the proper chord let's do it four times in a row one and two and here we go and one and two three [Music] fantastic this is the introduction by the way uh we have an introduction then we have to learn the verse which happens to be the same as the introduction then we have to learn the chorus which happens to be different from the from the verse and then we have to learn that second half of the chorus which is different from the first half I'm good we got that out of the way we're gonna play the pattern one time on this first chord one two three four then you're gonna love this you just take this exact same chord shape and you slide it one fret back so we were on four and three you just slide it back so now you're on three on the a string and two on the D string and you play the exact same pattern again thumb pointer thumb middle beautiful beautiful chord you hear that um you're never gonna guess what we do next that's right we slide it back another fret so now you're on the second fret of the a string still with the ring finger middle fingers on the first fret of the D string um what I would like to do is play these three chords in a row we're just gonna do that four note picking pattern one time on each chord should sound like this and We're Off to the Races collecting bugs already I'm gonna calm down don't worry I am going to calm down we're gonna need to repeat this a lot because we have all these patterns and all these notes and repetition is the mother of invention is what they always say so we're gonna practice this thing three times in a row one and two oh one day here we go one two three four next chord next chord then one two start over [Music] screwed it all up one do here we go and then now I have to remember what happens next Let's see we go I screwed everything up we have to do it twice on each chord not once we're gonna go that makes it so much better you were like bruh you don't do it once per chord you've lost your mind okay go through the intro again but we're gonna do it two times on each chord does that make sense one two nice and slow and first chord second chord third chord one two do it again [Music] I really do need to remember what comes next we go [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I remember it's the whole next part of the song are we ready to do the whole next part the second half of the intro I think we are I'm ready I love this part I love it top string is already out of tune I told you I told you next part of the song is my favorite part should I start this whole thing over what do you think I've got I'm just I'm just I'm just not feeling settled today I'm feeling antsy pantsy I Got Ants in My Pants bug collector so it makes sense right I think it's a sign okay I'm just gonna get settled just gonna just gonna get all comfy settled for the next part I love it I love it watch this you get to give all your fingers a break your left hand gets to come away from the strings you're gonna play the top string open with your thumb beautiful job then with your thumb and your pointer finger I'd like you to pinch together the middle two strings of the guitar the D string and the g string so you've got thumb up on the top and then the middle two just like that so we go thumb middle two thumb middle two great great great great right after you play those middle two you're going to I use what I use my pointer finger you're gonna play the middle two strings and with your pointer finger hammer on to the second fret of the G string so that's the third string from the bottom right after you play it open with your pointer finger just hit the second fret and try to pin your finger down on to the actual neck of the guitar you're trying to strangle the string between your finger and the neck of the guitar just like that it's gonna take some practice to get the right aim but you can do it you're a hard worker you've got grit determination perseverance fortitude all of those things let's go like this a couple times let's go boom pow um hey hey [Music] okay oh yeah yes sir yes guy all right yeah I think you've mastered it I think you've mastered the song immediately following that hammer on play the top string with the thumb again so we've got thumb Hammer thumb oh now this is where things start getting interesting immediately following that thumb up on the top string your middle finger is going to play the open second to bottom string the B string and then I'm gonna give you one more note right away then your thumb plays the D string the third string from the top open so those three notes we just added were top with the thumb second from the bottom with the middle third from the top with the thumb observe you see that right there we are going to play these something just changed what just happened have I been okay hang on hang on hang on we are going to play those six notes together nice and slowly it's gonna be one two three four five six let's do it even slower one two here we go and one hammer and let's do it one more time and oh Hammer the way that I'm taking these tiny little fragments and forcing you against your will to play them over and over again is probably how you should be practicing on your own but I you know I don't know what works best for you though you might have your whole own way of practicing who of who am I to tell you how to do let me show you the next part look look so we just we just ended where you did that hammer on with your pointer finger then we went ping ping pong right here's what happens next keep your pointer finger on that second fret right there of the G string you're going to play the top string with your thumb and then with your pointer finger play that very same g string your pointer fingers on you're gonna pinch them together like that you're going to do yet another hammer on but this time we're gonna use the ring finger to hammer on to the fourth fret of the G string hold your pointer finger down don't lift up your pointer finger pinch them together hammer on with the fourth fret of the ring finger you can't hammer on with a fourth fret I need to think about what I say before I say things all right great we've got a couple more notes immediately following that hammer on You're Gonna Play The D string third string from the top with your thumb then play the open B string second string from the bottom with your middle finger I recommend keeping these fingers here but you're gonna have to make sure that your fingers aren't leaning down onto the other strings you're on it you want to keep the other strings clear we just did Hammer D string B string and then immediately after that your thumb is going to play the top string again and then my favorite may be my favorite note of the entire song although it's actually two notes you're gonna pinch together the middle two strings while still holding your ring finger down pinch those together weather and give that little ring finger note a little bendy Bend like that little Bend bendy Bend so that was now the Rhythm slows down a little bit there we go those last two notes are slow all the other notes are getting like a half a beat each those last two notes get a full beat each [Music] the whole second half of the intro we just learned goes like this [Music] my challenge for you on this day is to play that two times in a row with me at that very speed one two here we go [Music] did it you did it and now I think we are in a physical emotional and mental place a spiritual place to play the entire intro all the way through which means we're gonna go pouch and then the next part that I just completely forgot what it is let's play the whole intro together nice and slow you and me one two one and two and here we go and [Music] here we go [Music] guys that's the intro to bug collector by Haley Hendricks probably should just stop the video there but I'm not gonna we have two other sections to learn and I'm so excited about it I can't even stand it how how much I'm looking forward to telling you the billions of other notes in this song all right I gotta Chuck these into here because otherwise they rattle against my guitar should we so okay so the intro being just to recap the intro is that pattern twice on each of those three descending chords then we go to the fancy part and we do that twice in the song she plays it and then she plays it again immediately afterwards great the verse exactly the same as the intro literally every note exactly the same now to be fair sometimes she'll throw little teeny variations in there that come and go throughout the song We're Not Gonna worry about those we're going to learn the main pattern that she does 94 of the time and then as you get more comfortable with that you'll start to hear little changes or you won't and who cares so let's get into the chorus of the song We'll practice the verse a little bit more probably I don't know maybe probably not who am I kidding let's let's learn the chorus chorus goes like this [Music] foreign my top string once again it has gone completely out of oh we're good I did it I just had to just had to adjust my Capo friends friends and relatives hi my name's Stuart welcome guitar lessons with Stuart like And subscribe if this content is content for you um of course it's gonna go like this you're gonna start off by just playing the top string open with your thumb great then you're gonna hammer on with your middle finger to the second fret of the top string so we've already done the hammer on you know what's up with that hammer on top string second fret never survive here what I recommend is at the same time you hammer on with that middle finger go ahead and hammer on with your ring finger to the second fret of the D string the third string from the top we don't actually need a hammer on there but we're gonna need that note in a minute so we might as well get it ready so check this out Hammer see how my two fingers are both going down at the same time then your thumb over here immediately goes in place the D string third string from the top that you just put that note on so it's just like that hammer film Hammer thumb what could do hammer thumb how are you then pointer finger plays the G string third string from the bottom all right we're gonna race through these next few notes check it out hammer thumb on the D string pointer finger on the G string then thumb goes back up to the top string middle finger plays the B string second string from the bottom and then your thumb plays the D string third from the top pointer plays a g string third from the bottom so we just did Hammer thumb pointer on those middle two strings thumb up on the top middle finger on the B string and then you're gonna go thumb on the D string Point your finger on the G string one and two and here we go and Hammer thumb pointer thumb middle thumb point or one and two and one more time and Hammer thumb pointer thumb middle thumb pointer great job you earned a star then then keep these fingers here don't move them pinch together the top string and the second to bottom string with your thumb and middle finger then your thumb and pointer finger are gonna play those middle two strings one at a time again so that was pinch thumb pointer do you do you understand what I'm doing here pinch thumb pointer and then we're gonna play the same little four note pattern we played Just platter and we play just a moment ago you're gonna go thumb on top middle and second to bottom thumb on the D pointer on the G's that was top second to bottom middle two what we just played was this Hammer middle do thumb middle [Music] well that was wrong one two here we go [Music] that sounds kind of cool kind of spooky Wonder baby [Music] let's do it one more time karate chop and here we go and [Music] I think it's difficult to get that like the beginning not bad but getting that pinch where you pinch those two together in the middle that's tough so it's like [Music] do this redonkulously slowly and then here's the next part then your thumb plays a top string great fantastic then using your thumb and middle finger pinch together the D string third string from the top and the B string second string from the bottom but take your time with these notes just go ping pong what good do Hey Ho Ping pow okay great then we're gonna go like this uh I have to remember aha I remember we do we do this we we kind of like interpolate the the pattern keep these fingers here you like this you just did that then you're gonna go thumb up thumb on top pointer finger on the G string third from the bottom thumb on the D string third from the top and then middle on the B string second from the bottom so that was like this thumb pointer thumb middle you're going to do that four note pattern three times one two three okay I said three so I should stop at three and not act like I'm gonna play four here's what we've just done for the chorus we went [Music] pretty crazy right pretty crazy let's do it one more time why did I just start acting like I'm not allowed to move did you notice that I just started going usually I'm moving all over the place and then I just I froze what no here we go [Music] slow down great I think we by George I think we've got it but now it's time to learn what I think I think this part is the most difficult part of the entire song it's not like although it's not going like Fast bug collector it's not doing that it's just um it's just the rhythm is tricky here but we have to do it we have to here's what it sounds like [Music] see I told you it's hard all right so let me just let's just do it let's just do it and you can thumb plays a top string great we've already done that a thousand times thumb plays the top string all right then you're going to pinch together the D string and the B string second from the bottom third from the top I use my thumb and my middle finger pinch them together great nice and slow no big deal there I do that every day of my life then your thumb goes back over the top fantastic this isn't hard this is easy why did you say this was hard great then immediately after playing that top string your middle finger is gonna bounce up to the B string second string at the bottom so now we've got ping pong pinky ping pong pinga do it with me one two Kalamazoo oh [Music] ah okay hardest part hardest part of the song You're Gonna pinch together the middle two strings with your thumb and pointer finger have you noticed I'm slurring all my words today I wonder if I have some sort of a thing growing in my brain that's making me slur my words one two here we go that the timing's weird one two do it one more time ping pong pinky pong okay great Point our finger goes to the second fret of the G string third string from the bottom [Music] all right pinch together top string and the g string with that pointer finger there then thumb is going to play the D string middle finger plays the B string second string from the bottom so that was pinch thumb middle hey pinch the middle here's what we just did [Music] so that was oh metal great three more notes and then we're gonna and then we're gonna learn more notes great perfect top string with your thumb pointer finger on the G string third string from the bottom thumb on the D string open third string from the top so watch this we're going [Music] one two three four one more time here we go [Music] we're halfway through the really difficult part that I hate I don't I don't hate it I love it it sounds beautiful I just hate talking about it I don't want to talk about it right after you finish that uh you're gonna take your pointer finger off of that g string you're gonna pinch together the E string the top string and the g string open that's the third the third string from the bottom pinch them together then your thumb plays the D string third from the top and then put your pointer finger back on the second fret of the G string oops and play that with your pointer finger so that was pinch thumb second fret oh pinch thumb second fret okay then your thumb goes back up to the top like that so pinch thumb pointer thumb on pinch thumb pointer thumb I messed up pinch thumb pointer thumb great then slowly you play the middle two strings again pinch them together with your thumb and pointer finger so that was pinch thumb pointer um oh and get rid of your pointer finger there over here what a nightmare it's just endless to open strings third from the bottom second from the top use your pointer finger this is 10 hours long it's and it's also going to be um what's another thing it's gonna be leave your comments in the comments below about what other things is this video gonna be one two it's what are we starting to start counting on I just started counting off not knowing why I was counting off I just and now I have to remember to cut that sip of coffee out of the video I kicked my camera [Music] there was a fly buzzing around and I was looking forward to making a joke about like there's a fly buzzing around and it's a bug collector but uh but it stopped and there aren't any open windows or anything so it must have died right it must have just died well I don't remember where we were do you we just did this and then we did this [Music] okay remember that no great and then right after you pinch those middle two strings together then you're gonna pinch the other thumb on the top string pointer finger on the open D string third from the top we're very close to being done with with this part so you pinch those together then your thumb plays the D string open and then your middle finger plays the B string second from the bottom open and then you're gonna play the top string open so that was this [Music] you're like I do not got it at all two more notes for this section of the song right after that you're just gonna do pointer finger on the G string thumb on the D string sounded like this so this whole second half of the chorus we just learned goes like this [Music] it's a lot of notes I know let's play the whole chorus all the way through then I will show you the cool part of the song that goes foreign it's great it's going to be fun that'll be a nice little treat at the end and that'll be our dessert but first we have to play the chorus all the way through starts with a hammer on I know you don't remember at all just listen just sit back and listen to me do it one two very slowly here we go [Music] then you do the exact same thing again remember on all that stuff again for the chorus so you do that twice for the chorus and then we're done with the chorus or at least the first there's another part of the song I don't know if I should call it chorus part 2 or interlude or whatever but I need to just like stand up for a second and then I'll be back and we'll learn the next part we actually truly are almost done like actually honestly to goodnessly we're almost done with this song we have to learn the part with the high thing because foreign we have to learn that part do you see how I messed up in the middle and then totally acted like I didn't mess up put your ring finger on the eighth fret of the B string eighth fret is weird because of the Capo I you just have to count from here one two three four five six seven eight it looks like the 14th fret but it's the eighth fret from the Capo ring finger right on that note you're gonna pinch you're gonna play that no with your middle finger but at the same time play the top string with your thumb fantastic beautiful gorgeous I love it then your thumb plays the D string open third string from the top and you're gonna go ping pong then your thumb goes right back up to the top so we've got thumb thumb pinch thumb thumb hey pinch thumb thumb you can practice this all night long great oh pinch thumb thump then pointer finger plays the G string third string from the bottom and then right after that thumb plays the D string third string from the top so we've got pinch thumb thumb pointer thumb let's do that one more time together shall we one two here we go and pinch thumb thumb pointer thumb pinch thumb thumb pointer thumb pinch thumb thumb pointer thumb I tricked you I said one more time I made you do it three times so we do that once [Music] nope then then you're going to get rid of your ring finger and put your middle finger on the seventh fret of that same string so we were right here with ring finger you're just gonna move back one fret with the middle finger just like that and you do the exact same pattern exact same picking just with that different finger placement just like that let's practice going from eight to seven a couple times what do you say one two here we go [Music] seven let's go back to eight eight then seven nice job now pretty soon you'll be working it up to full speed yo [Music] oh that's very nice but we only do that once we go eight seven then we're actually gonna go to five five on the same string but the picking pattern changes now you're gonna go this is a little tricky a little tricky I'm gonna warn you pinch together the B string and the E string just like that your thumb is going to come down play the D string so so far it seems like we're doing the same pattern but it's not right after your thumb plays the D string put your ring finger back on seven and play that with your middle finger so it's pinch thumb ah pinch thumb seven and then immediately after that your thumb goes back up to the top string oh oh oh all right all right we're doing it right after that seven you can take your time here but you're gonna get rid of your ring finger put your pointer finger back on five of the B string then pinch together the B string with your middle finger second to bottom string and the D string with your thumb just like that so five thumb seven thumb pinch five thumb seven thumb pinch four more notes to finish up this little thing right here then you're gonna play the top string and the B string open thumb plays the D string open then you're going to pinch together the top string and the g string third from the bottom and then play the D string again so those last four notes were pinch thumb pinch thumb do that one more time here we go and pinch thumb pinch thumb this whole interlude part that we've learned so far goes eight then seven then five thumb seventh thumb five open thumb pinch thumb this song is just full of All These Little Gems that you just get to practice for hours on end okay then we repeat that same thing again but there's a little change at the end check it out so the first time we went eight seven five seven five open thumb open thumb then the second time we're gonna go eight same thing seven same thing five seven so so far it's the same we get to that same part where we go five thumb seven top string open and then we're gonna play the D string and the B string second from the bottom and third from the top open so that was five thumb seven top open wow that sounds confusing [Music] I'm just getting to the open strings earlier than we did the first time at this point you're going to play the first part of the chorus again the first part of the chorus was the part with the hammer on where we went [Music] I think I messed that up a little bit but you remember that right so I suppose we should play this whole interlude part one more time what do you say let's do it one two from the eighth fret here we go eight thumb seventh thumb five seven five open thumb pinch thumb eight thumb seventh thumb five seven open chorus [Music] but you get it I'm allowed to do that right I'm allowed to just play something wrong uh and then just pretend that you are okay with that and then move on so I think the last thing we should do is I think we should play through everything one more time and then I'm gonna go I'm gonna play through all the sections of the song I have medium slow speed and not super slow but a little slower than the actual recording so you can hear how it all fits together it'll be it'll be great and I'll kind of talk through it a little bit starting with the intro one two here we go intro remember this part seems like it was ages ago we do all the intro again [Music] then we do the verse which is the same as the intro I talked about that remember [Music] I think they do it four times we're just gonna do it twice here's the second time foreign [Music] second part [Music] then again the hammer part again thank you I messed up whatever who cares second part again then seven I played something weird [Music] it's okay I didn't overreact [Music] probably back to the verse but you should try to do it better than I just did it oh whatever who cares"
