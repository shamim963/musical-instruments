    "Transcript": "90% of people trying to learn guitar quit in the first year and if you're trying to teach yourself your chances of coming out of the winning side of that statistic after a whole year are even worse but don't give up hope because I've spent the last seven years going from [Music] this to this [Music] using nothing but completely free online resources as a selft talk guitarist and in this video I've put together the top five tips I wish I knew as a beginner guitarist to help you go from knowing nothing to becoming a successful self-talk guitarist winning the 90% statistic and learning in half the time it took me if you apply these tips and make sure you stick around to the end because tip number five is probably the most important advice you will ever get as a selft talk guitarist let's get into it tip number one YouTube and songster is all you need musician simply guitar unnecessary now I'm not saying that you shouldn't use them and if they work for you then that's fantastic but I find YouTube and sster which are both completely free by the way I explain what songster is in just one second uh to be a very comprehensive and synergetic teaching Duo that taught me everything I know now pay close attention because I'm about to break down my exact process for learning new things on the guitar with these two applications I just mentioned first I searched up a YouTube YouTu video of the song I want to learn note that this can also be a riff scale uh chord shape whatever it may be I'm just using song for Simplicity just to get a feel for the Rhythm and Melody this is a crucial First Step that will accelerate your learning drastically because by listening to the song first and internalizing the melody and the notes now your brain can associate certain notes with fingerings and Frets on the guitar something that takes most guitarists decades to Master Okay step two search up a YouTube tutorial video of the song once again it can mean scale riff chord whatever you want to learn and for most popular songs there should be some of my favorite people to learn from include Gareth Evans Paul Davids and Marty music there are linked Down Below in the description if there isn't a tutorial video on YouTube you're going to have to look up tabs now if you don't know what tabs are it's essentially like sheet music for guitar and they're super super valuable to selft talk guitar so put that on your things to learn do take note that this is a more advanced way to learn than tutorial videos so it's generally a good idea to start out with tutorials and preferably tutorials with tabs on the screen like this one before moving on to just tabs alone I prefer to use a website called songster for using tabs just because they're pretty accurate they have pretty much any song out there and they also have this very useful playback feature where you can listen to what this song should sound like and then try to emulate that this takes us to a very important point on tabs though that you should always always always cross reference what you're learning on the tabs to what the actual performance video of someone playing it even when using a playback feature like songsters because not only does it help your note recognition like we were talking about before but also Tabs are often wrong and even if they are correct correct they don't give you any information about the Rhythm so it's a crucial step that you cross reference what you're learning on the tabs with the actual video personally I'll often use a combination of tutorials tabs and just learning by ear uh especially as you develop that note recognition so just use anything you can get your hands on tip number two no gear no problem as a beginner guitarist it's always tempting to just go buy a bunch of cool gear right I mean you're going to need an acoustic an electric then that means that you also need a guitar cable guitar amp pcks you're going to need capos tuners right this is literally all you need no tuners you can just use one of the hundreds of free guitar tuning apps out there personally I use Guitar Tuna no electric guitar you can play pretty much all the same stuff on acoustic at least until you've assured yourself that you're not going to quit and then you can go out and buy an electric guitar because the last thing in the world that you want to do is go buy an expensive guitar and then two weeks later decide that you don't want to play guitar anymore and no picks I personally believe that every guitar should start off finger style where you pluck the strings with your fingers instead of with a pick just because it develops your dexterity and strength in your right hand your picking hand so much faster than using a pick does even a capo is UN necessary not only because you can play the same [Music] songs just down you know on the [Music] neck but also because you can actually make one using nothing but a couple rubber bands and a pencil I will say that there is a case where as as you advance some guitar gear can actually help you progress but we'll get into that in tip number five tip number three just play something I want to start this off by saying that a lot of self-taught guitarists make the mistake of teaching themselves bad habits so whenever you're watching an advanced guitarist perform or do a tutorial video I want you to pay special attention to how they're holding their guitar the shape their wrist is in how they're holding the pick if they're using one and it may seem kind of silly right now but trust me doing this simple step right now and getting good habits nailed down rather than bad ones is going to save you years of frustration and waste of time down the road all that being said though you just have to play something like when I'm a beginner I find myself trying to make sure that I follow all the right steps and do everything in the right order so that everything's going to fall into place later down the road and I'm not doing anything the wrong way but I'm going to tell you right now there's no right thing to learn first a right way to start learning the guitar the most valuable thing that you can be doing with your time right now is just have having a guitar in your hands for instance this was the first RI that I learned but I could have just as easily learned something like this or maybe like this it's not really as important what you learn it's just that you're learning something and then you have the guitar in your hands so remember to pay attention to good technique but don't let that stop you from logging as many hours as possible with the strings underneath your fingers hey guys future me here um if you're enjoying the video so far and you think might be beneficial for others to see these tips then it really helps the video and the channel is whole get out to more people if you just hit liked subscribed I really appreciate it now let's get back to the video tip number four schedule and goals over the hump if your guitar journey is anything like mine it'll probably end up looking a little like this you start here at skill level zero and zero years spent practicing then as you start investing the first hours into practicing you'll see visible progress you'll start learning chords and new songs even if they're very basic and it's fun to practice and create sound But Here Comes The Beginner's worst nightmare the hump this is where practicing is going to feel like a chore you'll struggle to up your caliber of songs your fingers will Blister in pain and it'll feel like guitar just isn't meant for you this is probably where most of that 90% quit but that's because they're not sticking to a schedule and setting smart goals now when I say schedule this can mean anything from 3 hours a day to a half hour a week it's all up to you and what your goals are as a guitar player but the important thing is that you set a date and you don't miss it if you slip then it becomes easier and easier to do that again so if you're going to set a schedule for one week make sure it's something that you can stick to now on top of creating a schedule you'll need smart goals this means goals that are specific for instance learning a certain song or scale measurable don't set a goal like I want to play better they're attainable be realistic in what you can accomplish and don't push yourself too hard I mean Excellence does take time they're relevant set goals that are in line with the specific style you want to master are you a hybrid picker or a finger style guitarist a rock star or a jazz guy and they're time bound set a deadline for yourself to learn a specific song or scale or whatever it may be once again don't go too intense because that'll lead to burnout especially during the hump phase and stick with it that's it with scheduling and goal setting you'll be able to get past any hump and once you're back into that upward sloping portion of the graph which you'll know because practicing will start to feel fun again then now you can kind of adjust how you set goals and schedules there on based on you know becoming more laxed when it feels burdensome and adding it back on when you have the drive to do so because of tip number five which is make it fun this is by far the most important tip of the video so if you only remember one thing from the five tips that I gave you this is the thing to remember because if you make guitar playing fun then you're going to want to play and if you want to play You're going to play more and you're going to get better faster and most importantly you're not going to quit now I know this sounds kind of obvious but I think this is the biggest reason why that 90% of people quit well how do you keep guitar playing fun you ask well first off prioritize learning songs and riffs that you like to learn rather than just grinding scales all day or you know learning music theory unless of course that's fun for you secondly and I know this one sounds simple but keep your guitar visible around the house this might mean that you have to go buy a stand for it but trust me it is the best adjustment you'll ever make because just having it visible where you can easily go grab it when you have the temptation to do so is going to lead to so many more hours practicing on the guitar and so many hours getting better and having fun and lastly don't be too hard on yourself when it comes to meeting schedules and goals because you want to think about the long-term rather than the shortterm avoid burnout and become one of that 10% that moves on past the first year kind of going back to what I was saying at the end of tip number four you want to kind of play to your the curve of your guitar Journey so in those times where it's a hump and you need that extra structure to keep you playing and keep you motivated that's when you should be hard on your goal setting your scheduling but then when it starts to become more fun again and you kind of that upper sloping portion of the graph that you kind of you know lean back and pull off a little where you're still maximizing your productivity as a learner but you're not limiting the amount of fun that you're having on the instrument one last thought on making guitar playing more fun this goes back to gear um you know how I said how there is a case where as you advance some guitar deer can actually help you progress well this bad boy is probably one of the best investments I've ever made um it's just a Looper pedal which kind of allows you to jam with yourself [Music] but it opens up so many possibilities on the instrument and just makes it so much fun to play again so when the time comes as you advance I definitely recommend investing in one of those anyways That's all folks so thank you so much for watching all the way till the end and I wish you the best of luck in your selft talk guitar Journey as you continue on [Music] the"
