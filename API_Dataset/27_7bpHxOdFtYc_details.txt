    "Transcript": "i'm going to show you the top four finger picking \nguitar patterns in the travis picking style travis   picking is a finger picking approach named after \nthe guitarist merle travis these four patterns are   the most common and most basic finger picking \nguitar patterns to learn you can play them as   they are or you can expand on them in the future \nto play some very advanced sounding finger style   guitar and solo guitar arrangements which is what \nplayers like chet atkins did these finger picking   patterns are used all over the place in any music \nthat has somewhat of a finger picking guitar   sound folk guitar country music singer \nsongwriter music the beatles used them   simon and garfunkel bob dylan and tons and tons \nof artists today are using some of these exact   fingerpicking patterns to accompany themselves \nthe signature of this travis picking sound is   that one's thumb is constantly alternating bass \nnotes keeping a really really consistent sound   going in the bass role and then the fingers are \nfilling out the chords with various patterns and   notes on top of that and then melody can even \nbe played on top of those two things as well   when you put that all together it creates \nthis very appealing fingerpicking guitar   sound because we're playing the role of at least \ntwo musicians if not three we get this full rich   self-contained kind of full music sound with just \none instrument i'm going to show you each of the   four finger picking guitar patterns with different \nstring groupings because different chords use   different strings i'm going to demonstrate each \npattern through a common chord progression slowly   and then fast and then i'll also demonstrate \neach finger picking pattern with a section of   a real song so we can hear how it sounds in real \nmusic that's what we're going to cover let's do it i'm jared borkowski from soundguitarlessons.com \nwhere i help guitarists gain more creative   control over music so we can express ourselves \nmore freely if you're new here welcome please   follow and subscribe i have new videos every week \nokay so the first pattern is called the inside   outside pattern we're gonna use a g chord for \nthis and every pattern is named based on what's   happening above the bass because the bass in \nall four patterns is going to be the exact   same so this is the bass line if you're playing \na g chord it's the one five one five of g okay   so that's just going this alternating base and \nthen the inside outside means that you're going   to play out of these two notes the third string \nand the second string the inside note and then   the outside tone it's just very simple alternating \nbetween those you have base inside base outside   base inside base outside that's it as simple \nas it is inside outside pattern this is on g   quick side note here don't ever put fingers \ndown with the left hand that you don't actually   need we're not playing a g chord like this \nwith this finger down with this finger down   i'm just only playing holding down at least \nthis third fret on the sixth string and then   with any sixth string rooted chord you're skipping \nthe a string and you're going to play the rest of   the notes above the root on the fourth third and \nsecond string so we're playing the root down here   on the sixth string and then you're playing \nstring three thumb jumps up to string four   second and then second string with your m finger \nwith your middle finger okay this is the pattern   the inside outside pattern now if you're going to \nplay a fifth string rooted chord let's go to a c   chord here then the pattern is just \ncontained in all four metal strings   so this is the inside outside pattern on c or \nany chord that's rooted off the fifth string   by default these things can make \nalterations on them which we'll talk about   another time but that's the fifth string rooted \nchords if it's a fourth string rooted chord then   you're just playing top four strings only so this \nis a d chord and you're playing the same pattern and then you got thumb inside thumb outside \nthumb inside thumb outside okay so with all of   these patterns the string groupings are the same \nsixth string rooted chord you're playing strings   five and then four three two fifth string rooted \nchord you're playing the middle fourth strings   fourth string rooted chord you're playing the \ntop of four strings again as default you can   venture away from that later and add more \ncomplexity to the patterns but this is the   foundational version of these fingerpicking \npatterns so here's a very common chord progression   that i'm going to play each pattern through this \nis the chord progression of one of my favorite   country songs of all time by buck owens called \nlove's gonna live here i'm gonna play half of it   at half time speed so you can see the pattern \nreally slowly and hear it functionally working   nice and slow through a chord progression then \ni'm gonna double speed for the second half so   you can hear how it sounds when it's sped up \nso here's the demonstration one two three four so now i'm going to sing the first verse \nof this song love's going to live here   just so you can hear how this super simple \ninside outside pattern which at first might   seem so basic how we're going to use it in \nreal music well it really works quite quite   well over real music it also is the foundation \nto get more complex finger picking patterns down   but it's great on its own too i'm going to speed \nit up quite a bit just so you can hear how it   might sound if you work towards getting this \nfaster and using it as your own accompaniment oh   the sun's gonna shine in my life once \nmore love's gonna live here again things are gonna be the way they were \nbefore love's gonna live here again time for pattern two we're not gonna \nneed to spend much time here because   it is just the flip it's called the outside \ninside and you already know what it's to be we're   keeping the base the same all the time and you're \ngoing to play thumb outside thumb inside thumb   outside thumb inside the groupings of the \nnotes along with the chords stay the same   everything's the same you're just flipping \noutside and inside so so here's that same   progression nice and slow and then doubling \nthe speed halfway through one two three four now let's listen to it in the context \nof our song in real music i'm gonna   play it nice and fast again and this \nis the chorus of love's gonna live here   the progression is the same throughout \nthe whole song this is the chorus   love's gonna live here love's gonna \nlive here love's gonna live here again no more loneliness only okay the next pattern is when it gets fancy \nthis is called the pinch pattern and it is   the most common finger picking pattern of all \ntime and the most useful if there's one you're   ever going to learn it should be this one it is \njust fantastic sounds good slow sounds good fast   it is just a wonderful pattern and the \nfirst two are a great foundation to then   creating this pattern especially the outside \ninside because the pinch pattern is simply   two outside inside patterns in a row except \nthe first one we're going to do this motion   that is called the pinch motion because you're \nplaying thumb you're plucking with thumb   and the m finger the middle finger \nat the same time towards each other   in this pinching motion so that's called the \npinch so we're pinching and because we played   those two together we're letting it sustain or \nyou can think of it as kind of resting for a note   instead of going base outside base inside \nyou're going together weight base inside instead of okay so you got a little a \nlittle syncopation there which is what   makes this is gonna sound like it kind \nof bounces and has more texture to it so   okay and the second time you're just playing \na normal outside inside so you got pinch thumb   inside okay so pinch weight thumb inside thumb \noutside thumb inside that is the pattern pinch   weight thumb inside thumb outside thumb inside \nexcept and that's totally the pinch pattern i   like to take away the very last eighth note \nthe very last inside as well so it gets even   a little more of a bounce to it okay so i like \nto take that last note away which will be this the reason taking that last knot away is \nnice is that if you want to work towards   playing really fast finger picking it gives you \na little space the syncopation sounds great too   but it gives you just a little space to switch \nchords and to just have it feel more relaxed   with the right hand so i typically play it that \nway if we filled it in it would sound like this just a little crammed to throw that in and \nget back to the pinch so i like to leave that   out so that's the pinch pattern the \ngrouping of the strings is the same   here it sounds here's what it sounds like on c   i'm swinging it a little bit too you can play it \nnice and straight or swing nice and straight or swinging a little either way here it is on d \nokay now here it is through our progression   it's nice and slow and then speeding it up \ndouble speed halfway through one two three four all right let's plug it into our song we're gonna \ndo the second verse of love's gonna live here   same tempo same progression just so we can hear \nthat context of the pinch pattern as accompaniment   in a real song i hear bells are ringing i hear \nbirds are singing love's gonna live here again you hear how the pinch pattern has that bounce \nto it it's just so effective as an accompaniment   pattern it's just fantastic finger picking pattern \nto play with that's the one i used in the intro   of this video as well okay the fourth pattern \nin our top four finger picking guitar patterns   is called the descending arpeggio because it does \nexactly that it arpeggiates the chord from the top   downward we're going to do a pinch and then \nplay the middle note and then the thumb does   its thing it's never going to change the thumb is \nalways doing it so now the top note of the thumb   baseline is part of this arpeggio descending \narpeggio structure okay so i'll just let you   look at it on the screen while i play it really \nreally slowly so you can mimic that if you need to   the descending arpeggio part is so the thumb the bass is kind of taking part of   this melodic sound if you want to listen \nto it that way okay that's what it is on g you can just apply that to the middle \nfour strings or the top four strings   okay here it is through our progression \nsuper slowly than speeding up halfway   through like we've been doing one two three four as for plugging it into the song well this song \nis so beautiful and so simple it just has those   two verses and then it has the chorus so we could \nsing the chorus again for this but you heard the   chorus before let's do a guitar solo over this \ndescending arpeggio pattern so we can hear it in   context of music so i'll play through the \nprogression exactly the same way with the   descending arpeggio pattern and then play a guitar \nsolo on top of it for our song one two one two if you want some really beautiful really amazing \ncords to practice your finger picking guitar   patterns with then definitely download my chord \nchart called chords with color it's unlike any   other chord chart out there it shows a bunch \nof chords through several keys and then tons   of alternative options for each of those chords so \nyou can add color to them and extensions and just   beautiful alterations that still work equally \nwell in whatever setting your chord was in   a song you're working on or performing and it's \njust wonderful for listening to sounds practicing   technique studying the chord theory of something \nand working on finger picking guitar patterns   so check that out free download you can go to \nchordswithcolor.com or just click the link in   the top of the description so which fingerpicking \nguitar pattern out of the four was your favorite   and which one are you going to commit to learning \nso you can use it in any and every song that you   work on next was it the inside outside pattern \nthe outside inside pattern the pinch pattern or   the descending arpeggio pattern let me know in the \ncomments i would love to hear from you i post new   lessons every week next week i am going to share a \nsolo guitar arrangement of autumn leaves beautiful   simple easy arrangement and share \nthe sheet music for that as well so   hope to see you in that lesson take care \nthanks for watching and happy practicing"
