    "Transcript": "something just happened to me that I was not emotionally prepared for today as I was getting set up I broke my tripod like the plastic part that holds the camera it's my phone the plastic part that holds my phone just broke off completely so I just like there's this little hole and I just jammed it in the hole as hard and deep as I as I could and then it kind of stayed so we're just going to pretend that life is okay and I don't want the world to see me and I want you to know you're just fine oh Iris by the googa dolls my name is Stuart Alexander Layman brown people of the world friends and relatives broken tripods everything is fine we're perfectly happy iris is the song it's in the worst tuning I've ever heard of in my entire life I refused to do it so we're doing it in stand tuning guys literally completely normal standard tuning no capo no no I am I am I'm afraid to say it because of it's potentially touchy subject but I do indeed not have shoes or socks on today and I did just drop the Capo onto my toe exactly standard tuning no capo no bar Chords it's honestly going to be pretty fun and it doesn't sound exact ly like when the guy does it but it's it's it sounds pretty good it sounds like the song let's start with the introduction the introduction we're going to go like this you're going to put your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom put your middle finger on the second fret of the third string from the bottom put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top and then you you would like to have your thumb come up and just mute the top string guys this is known as a B minor 7 chord you can hear like it sounds kind of like the song Iris by the goooo dolls it doesn't have the exact same open ringness because we're in standard tuning but it's going to get the job done you're going to go like this you're going to go bow bow you're going to play that twice then you're just going to slide your ring finger into the second fret so now you have pointer finger and middle finger in the exact same spots but ring finger is on the second fret of the second string from the bottom you're going to play this once and then there's a tiny little pause and then you go boom boom so we've got pow pow pow pow pow one two pow pow Power Wheels pow pow pow fantastic this by the way is called a B minor 9 chord we have B minor 7 B minor 9 this won't be on the test but there will be an extra credit assignment that involves knowing the names of these chords then we're going to go to a G major 7 chord go ahead and lift lift up your pointer finger and your middle finger move your ring finger into the third fret of the second string from the bottom middle finger Place three on the top string and then your pointer finger is going to play two on the bottom string the chords for the verse and the chorus are easier than this I'm going to tell you that the intro and the bridge a little bit tricky Verse Chorus pretty easy my name is Stuart Alexander Layman Brown as I've said at least one or two times before this was would be the time where you would say this guy is great I like the way that he talks about his tripod being broken and then you subscribe to the channel also as I said no bar chords in this video but if you would like to improve your bar chord skills go to Marin music.com and go sign up for my free barcod course it's great you're going to love it Link in the description my name is Stuart Alexander L Brown on this G major 7 chord you're going to strum one two then get rid of your pointer finger now it's a G6 chord strum that and then uh go ahead and put your pinky on the third fret of the bottom string and strum it twice so that part there was bow BW bow BW bow one two just play that little part pointer pointer open pinky pinky one more time with all of your heart bow bow open pinky pinky let's play the entire intro goes like this it goes [Music] switch I messed up a little bit but you know what I'm going to nail it on this next one you're going to mess up this time but then you're going to nail it on the next one let's do that introduction dose times in a row that's Spanish for two surprised you didn't know that one two get I'll give you yes the the first chord I'll remind you is ring finger middle finger pointer finger you got it B minor seven 1 2 3 4 bow bow bow one two switch then again I keep messing up there guys I nailed it the time when I said I was going to nail it I hammered it when you hammered it and we both hammered it at the same time it was very very romantic what do you think should I cut that out of the video okay so that was the introduction you just do that twice done easy piece of pie piece of cake lemon squeezy time now we're going to learn the verse to the song which goes let me play you the verse once through and then we'll learn it one two three here I [Music] go that's it let's do it all right so guys you're going to do a d it's like a D5 chord here's what I'm going to have you do I'm going to have you put your ring finger on the third fret of the second string from the bottom pointer finger second fret third string from the bottom thumb mutes the top string thumb is going to be doing a lot of muting on this song you guys this is a D5 chord something I didn't mention is you would really like your ring finger to just lean down and mute the bottom string all right I don't know why I'm I canot showing you anything I'm trying to show you how my pointer finger there we go see how my pointer fingers not like this it's kind of leaning down muting the bottom string f fantastic what an intimate moment we just shared with that muted string the language I'm using today I said romantic earlier I just said intimate it's the goooo Dolls bring it out of me they're a very sensual band you guys all right so on this D5 chord you're going to strum down down up down up here we go down down up down up that was fine down down up down up one more time down down up down up that's the strumming for the entire verse for the entire chorus just down down up down up then we switch chord so we go down down up down up on that D5 chord then you're going to go to an E minor 7 keep your ring finger in the same spot but lift up your pointer finger put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top middle finger second fret third string from the top and strum down down up down up notice my thumb just hinged up and got away from that top string because now we want the top string open so we've got d e 1 2 3 here we go don't want the blang don't want the blang Beautiful lyrics guys you might notice that if you're new to playing chords like this it can be a little tricky to switch from the D to the E minor here's what you do when you're strumming the D you go down down up down but then on your last strum up lift up your point finger and just strum the open strings as you get ready for the E minor so in Super Hyper slow motion it's down down up down and down see that let's do that together very slowly with that little lift up the fingers getting ready to put down one 2 3 very slow down down up down lift E minor down up down lift we lift up again getting ready for the next chord which happens to be a G chord you guys keep your ring finger in the same spot put your middle finger on the third fret of the top string put your pointer finger on the second fret of the second string from the top if you want you can put your pinky on the third fret of the bottom string but I don't for this song I just don't do it so now uh you're going to do the storming pattern twice on the G so it's down down up down up down down up down up let's play that all the way through d E minor G very slowly what o notice when you go from E minor to G you don't have to move your pointer finger or your ring finger I didn't even notice that very special 1 2 3 start with d d e minor G G again that's the first half of the verse we're already like we're already just cruising through it second half of the verse you play the B Minor 7 is said something about an extra credit assignment if you remember the names of the chords your extra credit assignment is can you figure out how to play the B minor 7 chord right now without me reminding you how to play it I will give you to the count of four 1 2 3 four five 6 7 eight nine 10 time's up let's see how you did no that's not it you don't get any extra credit points ring finger stays on the third fret of the second string from the bottom middle finger plays two third string from the bottom pointer finger place two second string from the top thumb mutes a top string remember now uh we do down down up down up regular strumming then we're going to switch to an a sus chord to play as suus all you have to do is take take your pointer finger and move it down to the third string from the top everything else stays the same so we have B minor 7 to a us then we're going to go to the G chord again and you do G twice again let's play that little section starting from the B minor 7 1 2 3 here we go down down up down up hey down up down up G down up down up we finished the verse let's play the verse all the way through D E minor G G B minor a g G one two 3 here we go let's do it again Uncle Stewart I did okay but I could have done a lot better if you just slowed down a little bit that was too fast for me you're you're asking too much of us well how do you think it looks if I just cuz here's what I'm worried about I'm worried that like right now my tripod is set up fine but I'm going to do more recording later and am I going to be able to get it in the same place or is it let's see what the camera on my computer looks like oh no that's not going to work at all okay well I'm going to I'll figure that that out later don't worry I'll figure it out when I'm not uh in the middle of recording a video guys for the verse the first verse you just play that pattern four times in a row you just play that whole eight chord progression quatra times Spanish for four did you know that then we go to the chorus I'm not even joking the chorus is just the second half of the verse four times in a row you just go like this you just go B minor 7 a g then you do it again and you just you do that four times in a row we might as well practice it we might as well practice it so just B minor 7 a g g four times 1 2 3 here's the verse don't want the world to see me and I don't even want them to know cuz when everyone's going to school cool I'm going to go to the show why is this song called iris is it just cuz he's looking through a telescope in the music video my name is Stuart Alexander L Brown and now I would like to tell you that we go to the interlude of the song The interlude is just you play the intro again that's all it is you just go that's it then we do the verse the second verse exactly the same as the first verse then we do the second chorus second chorus exactly the same as the first chorus then we go to the bridge the bridge is pretty fun you can also skip it if you want CU it's kind of more like the just like big instrumental orchestra violin breakdown part but here's what you do you go to the B Minor remember the B minor and B minor 7 and you go down up down up can you do that with me one two three you do it with me down up down up then slide your ring finger over so now you're doing the B minor 9 and go down up down up great then you're going to strum the B minor 9 one more time and then strum the regular B minor one more time so it's down up down up down up down up boom bam one two here we go up one more time here we go then you're going to go to G middle finger third fret top string pointer finger second fret second string from the top ring finger third fret second string from the bottom pinky third fret bottom string you're going to strum down down then this a little bit tricky get rid of your pinky remember I said the interlude no what did I say I said the intro and the bridge were a little tricky and it's turning out to be true so you get rid of your pinky and your pointer finger jump jumps down to the second fret on the bottom string and you're going to strum down down so we just went g g Boom Boom at this point in time you're going to put your pinky back on three strum this get rid of your pinky strum up and then get rid of your pointer finger andrum down so we went Binky bang guys take a look at this we go bang wait uh we booy boo bing bang g g Who whoop Banky bomb and then you start the whole thing over again I don't I'm not I'm thrilled with the way I'm demonstrating this also I'm not thrilled with this bit of hair that's sticking out right here one two here we go bang big goody bang bing bang g g Binky bang start it overy bangy bang bing bang bang bang bang bangy bang you play that I wrote down three times but I don't think that's true I think they do it more than three times maybe it's only three I don't know you play that play honestly there's no singing during this part just play that as many times as you want then you go back to the chy you do the chorus exactly the same as we did the other time and then at the very very very end of the song you have what's called a tag ending it's just where you take the last little line and you play it like one or two or three more times in this case we're going to play it two more times so what that means is we're going to play those three chorus chords the B minor a g we just do that an extra two times let's go ahead and play that extra two times right now and we're going to end on the G one two three here we go I got confused so I don't know do we need to play through I really don't want to play through yeah I think we're good go practice it sing it for your crush they're you're going to get married within within the hour I promise and I don't want the to see me"
