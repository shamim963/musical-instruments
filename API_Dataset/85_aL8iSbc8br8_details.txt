    "Transcript": "foreign [Music] or maybe I'll call it duvet what do you think about that how would you feel about it if I called it duvet uh we've got some strummy stuff we've got a finger picking solo thing but you could do it with a plectrum if you'd like let's start it should we start with the solo or the strummy part let's start with the strummy part get that over with then we'll do the exciting challenging solo part my name is Stuart welcome to guitar lessons with Stuart we have to learn three chords for this song A type of a G chord a type of B minor chord and also an E minor chord that's it for the chords let's learn the G chord first so here's how I play the G chord it looks like a g bar chord but I'm not actually barring see my pointer finger is hitting on the low E string but not touching the bottom strings let's go through it note by note pointer finger third fret on the E string this is in standard tuning by the way then your ring finger is gonna play the fifth fret on the a string the second string from the top pinky plays the fifth fret on the D string third string from the top then your middle finger plays the fourth fret on the G string those four fingers in place make sure the bottom two strings the high e and B strings are open so again again pointer finger is not smashing down like a typical bar chord it's angled up like that you play all the strings why is my watch talking to me how to play the B minor chord on guitar it was listening to us this entire time it's like a G6 chord cool chord I like it you also could play this chord like this middle finger on the third fret on the top then second fret then open open ring finger on the B string on the third fret and then just leave your pinky off so you have the high E string open that's another option I might do it like that occasionally but for this song I prefer to do it like this it's a little bit of a smoother sound and it's an easier transition for me into the next chord next chord is a B minor with an 11. take that G chord that you just played move it back one fret so now you're on the second fret and then move up a string so now you've got pointer finger on the second fret of the a string ring finger on the fourth fret of the D string pinky on the fourth fret of the G string and then middle finger on the third fret of the B string here's a challenge pointer finger you would like it to push on the second fret of the a string but then with the tiniest little tip of your finger have it mute top string the low E string that's a little bit of a challenge some people might want to bring their thumb up to mute it for me if I bring my thumb up here my fingers all crammed together and it's much too difficult so I keep my thumb back here tip of my pointer finger mutes the E string and make sure the high E string that bottom string is open so get your pointer finger out of the way there so B minor I guess it's like a B minor at 11. that's what we'll call it we can't call it a B minor 11 chord because there's no seven in this chord then we go to an E minor it's a plain old E minor chord so that's open E string second fret on the a string second fret on the D string and then all the rest of the strings are open sometimes you could throw in a pinky down here on the second fret of the E string that makes it into a like an E minor with a nine beautiful chord fits the song beautifully you also could sometimes use an E minor seven where you put your pinky on the third fret of the B string those are our three chords for the verse and for the chorus now we just need to learn the strumming pattern it's fast it's a lot of strums let's see if I can remember it that's the basic pattern we're going to try to keep that going but there might you can throw in little variations when you feel like it I'm sure they do that on the recording boa and their hit song duvet here's the strumming we're gonna do you're gonna do two strums down but I only want you to hit the top couple strings when you do that so don't hit everything just focus in really focus in on that low E string the top string you'll hit a couple other strings no big deal then do a big strum down where you play all the strings so we've got boom boom see that top top strap then let's see what happens next then we're just gonna do a big old down up so we've got down down down up hey and the the speed is like slow slow fast fast then we're gonna do [Music] sit down down up I'm not feeling this at all today I am not in the mood to play the song [Music] how am I doing so far how am I doing I fell down so far we've got down down down down up up down then you're gonna do another down so down down down down up up down down and then finally oh real quick down up down down down down up up down down up down down down down up up down down very slowly very slowly with a great view look at this [Music] that's the pattern how many strum is that one two three four five six seven eight nine maybe ten ish let's play it let's play it three times in a row together medium speed I'm gonna yell out all the downs and UPS it's gonna be a nightmare one two three and a four and a down down down [Music] just kind of play it a trillion times then you only do that once per chord so just down down down down up up down down down up switch to the next chord these chords are kind of tough there's a we're using four fingers for two of these chords how are you supposed to switch so quickly I'm supposed to I'm just supposed to go down up and then quickly be down on the next one no there's a trick if you recall our strumming pattern ends with down up really fast during that down up you are already gonna start switching to the next chord so watch this what watch down [Music] it sounds a little clunky when we do it slowly but if we speed it up listen listen to this doing that last down up down down down down up up down down start to switch I'm playing like the open strings while I'm switching chords it might be totally open they might be kind of muted see that especially if you're playing it fast that little where it's kind of not quite the chord but it's sort of some open strings and some muted stuff sounds very nice and rhythmic I love it so we are now going to play the entire vert this is the verse by the way in case you didn't know let's play the verse all the way through it's going to go like this G to B minor to E minor and then back to B minor that's our chord progression G B minor B minor B minor I believe they do this three times for each verse let's play the verse one time kind of slow I'll call out some stuff in the middle one two three four and a down down down down up up down down switch B minor then we go to E minor I set that a little bit too late for you then B minor foreign that's the verse to the song called duvet by boa let's learn to chorus real quick chorus goes like this same chords but different Rhythm different order we're going to start with E minor we're gonna go E minor I'm just trying one two three just four strums down down down down then go to the B minor chord down down to two Downs on it that one I hit kind of hard I go and then we're gonna do one strum at first of the G so it goes a little something like this [Music] oh but can't go and do it again [Music] after that you play that g you hold it out for a second and then we're just gonna go how many strums was that one two three four five six seven so you play it once let it sit for like for like a beat and then do seven strums I don't know how many that was I wasn't counting one two three four five one two three six seven six seven oh man [Music] very crucial notice with that with most of these chords here I'm just going down down down I'm really focusing on the top few strings but when I get to the G I do one big strum I let it sit for a beat and then the last seven strums I'm just focusing on the top again [Music] now there's this cool thing that they do uh the bass player I believe does it every time but the guitarist I think does it occasionally in the song but it sounds really cool I like to do it every time because it sounds good which is this we go so after you get to the G instead of strumming the g seven more times play on the top string five five seven seven then go down to the a string and play five five seven seven so that's one two three four five five seven seven five five seven oh oh I was wrong you don't play five five seven seven on the a string you only play the seven once so then right back to the minor okay I got it I gotta chill out I gotta chill it's so hot in here I'm wearing this sweater it's so hot do I look sweaty well we need to learn the solo the Solo's fun but it's kind of it's kind of difficult as well so totally different from the verse and the chorus the solo uh I think I think that their finger picking using fingers like this you could do with the pick if you want I actually I'm I'm actually not entirely sure it's really fast so trying to do with the pick my pick can that was not it at all I don't know what that was but when I'm playing with the pick my pick can kind of get caught in the strings a little bit I like using my fingers but here's a little trick that I do because we're using the pick before the solo and we're using the pick after the solo I forgot my pick see it and then I just slip it right in between my middle finger and my pointer finger for safe keeping until I'm ready for it again so again I was like I'm holding it and I just go like this I go let's see where's the best view I go uh how do I do it oh that's what I do my middle finger comes up and just kind of grabs it from my pointer finger and then my pointer finger comes off and then my pointer finger goes on top so I go boom that's not helpful to anyone look at that look at that you see that and then it's there it's there just comfortably between those two fingers and I can do all my finger picking stuff see it just stays there so I'm gonna that's what that's what I do you can throw it on the ground grab a new pick when you're done you can play this all with the pick I don't even give a flip what you do with the pick but let's learn the solo is Pinky on the fifth fret of the high E string pointer finger on the third fret of the B string the second string from the bottom and then middle finger on the fourth fret of the G string third string from the bottom we're gonna go like this so that was middle finger plays the bottom string then pointer finger plays the B string second from the bottom and then thumb plays the G string third string from the bottom so we've got those three fingers there we go see that we're gonna play that five times five times in a row is that five probably one two three four five beautiful fantastic great then you're going to take this exact same chord shape and you're gonna slide it up so your pinky is on the tenth fret so now starting from the bottom we've got pinky on ten pointer finger on eight and then middle finger on nine you're gonna do the same picking on that chord just one time so we've got first chord then up to the tenth fret it's beautiful it's beautiful after that your ring finger is going to go to the ninth fret on the high E string the bottom string and get rid of your pinky and do the same picking so that was ten nine see that right there then take this shape slide it one two Frets back and then bring your pointer finger in extra fret back did I say strings back or did I say Frets back I want my Frets back that's a Chili's commercial there's a reference to a Chili's commercial for baby back ribs we're gonna have a ring finger on the seventh fret of the high E string pointer finger on the fifth fret of the B string middle finger on the seventh fret of the G string we play the same picking some amount of times as a one time I don't remember just one dime on that so it's seven five seven then are you still with me this is the part this is the part that I I it's what I like to do is I take my pinky I stretch it all the way up to the ninth fret this is a little bit of a stretch but I think you can do it you're gonna keep these three fingers here bring your pinky all the way up to the ninth fret and do the same picking so that is a lot of stuff we just played a lot of stuff we have this chord five times then we went up to this one once your ring finger took over on the ninth fret you slid back to the seventh and fifth Frets then I had to stretch your pinky up to nine here is how I recommend practicing this Solo in the actual song they do it very fast don't try to do it that fast are you crazy we're gonna treat it like it's a nice slow classical song I want to practice this song like it's a classical piece of music and we're gonna play it nice and slow and romantic and just try to get the notes sounding clear and clean and keep a consistent Rhythm slowly and peacefully like this [Music] thank you [Music] see that wasn't that nice you could even do it slower do it so slowly if you feel like you're gonna throw up and then you'll know that you're playing it slow enough all right so we just did seven five seven pinky up to nine now abandon that crazy stretch of a chord play the ninth fret with your ring finger just totally by itself then play the 10th fret with your ring finger totally by itself so we went the reason I'm not using my pinky to play nine again is because we want to get the ring finger ready anyway and I want to give us a break from this crazy stretch of a chord I don't want to keep this chord all stretched out like that forever [Music] now we have to do something that I probably remember I remember we're going to play the 12th fret with the ring finger on the high E string pointer finger on the 10th fret of the B string and then middle finger on the 12th fret of the G string you're gonna play that chord just like that with that same picking then go up two Frets to 14 so now it's 14 12 14. just like that then go back down to 12 and 10. so that was [Music] then we're gonna go all the way back to the second chord we played with the solo this was pinky on 10 of the E string pointer finger on eight of the B string middle finger on nine of the G string oh my goodness so many chords back from here it was [Music] you see that oh beautiful I used ring finger for that chord instead of Pinky I don't care I don't even care then ring finger goes to the ninth fret of the high E string you're just gonna play it high E string High B string there's only one b string there's no high low B string give me a break and then put your pinky back onto 10 and play those same two strings so that was 9 10. okay how we doing how are we doing should we play this all the way from the beginning once very slowly let's do it start with this chord five three four here we go and one two three four five then up to ten ring finger seven pinky nine ten twelve fourteen twelve ten nine ten okay [Music] oh my God I'm getting so sweaty I'm getting so sweaty uh we just we just did this we just did nine ten then you're gonna go back to just nine with the ring finger on the high E string so that's nine on the bottom pointer finger eight on the second string from the bottom middle finger nine on the G string the third string for the bottom you're gonna play those three strings one at a time pinky goes to ten again do the same picking then go back to the nine with your ring finger then we're gonna go back to seven on the high e five on the B string seven on the G string and you're gonna play those three notes twice in a row okay we made it through the first half of the solo which actually is more like 75 of the solo let's play through that one more time together I know this is awful but we're gonna play through it once together then we'll learn the second part so we got five [Music] up to ten ring finger seven pinky nine ten twelve fourteen twelve ten nine ten nine ten nine seven seven I kind of I kind of stalled out for a second at the end there okay second half of the solo starts off exactly the same exactly the same go back to that first chord we were doing pinky on five of the high E string pointer finger on three of the B string middle finger on four of the G string you're gonna play five times two three four five back up to the tenth fret you go ten back to nine uh then we're gonna go back to the seven and the five stretch your pinky out again everything's exactly the same so far go nine ten exactly like we did before then we go back to 12 10 12 just like we did before we're gonna do our regular picking pattern one two three then go up to 14 exactly like we did before so far everything is literally exactly how we did it the first time so we go 12th fret 14 then back to 12. then back to 14 so that was 12 14 12 14 okay now things are changing a little bit go back to 12 but you're gonna just play the high E string then play the G string with your thumb so we are skipping the B string we're just going boom boom keeping this 12 10 12 chord over here so we've got 12 12 like that up to 14. do the same exact picking so that was just bing bong bing bang you see that so is oh so it's like one two three one two three one two three one two three one two one two counting it makes it where you count with it it helps I think right one two three one two three one two three one two three one two one two then we're gonna do that whole 12 to 14 things one more time we go 12 14. is that it uh [Music] yeah so there okay okay so after we did the bing bong bing bang then we do the bing bang bang one more time then we go all the way up to 19. bring your ring finger up to 19 on the high E string pointer finger on 17 of the B string middle finger on 19 of the G string and we're gonna play those three notes [Applause] uh what I do is I do it twice one two three one two three and then I just play that first note one more time and that gives me a little bit of time to get ready for the G chord again oh my goodness are you kidding me with that thing [Music] uh when you get up here you notice my thumb has to like pop out over here I can't reach around the back it just is too awkward if this is just on your guitar if you just can't if you could just barely get up there to these these Frets then for this last note just go just playing 19 on the high E string three times sound great No One's Gonna know nobody's gonna know how could they know did I get that Meme thing right I don't remember what it is that the whole song uh here's how they end it they go [Music] I don't remember they play the verse to the that's right they do the chorus and they just ended on that G chord that g with the Open high strings this this really was a bad one I think I think that this is this song has a good solo I think I know the notes to the solo and I told you what those notes are so that was a win but otherwise um I said a lot of numbers I will you have to admit I set a lot of numbers today I said a lot of string names today I did a lot of sweating today foreign [Music]"
